Occasionally someone asks me how I made my switch from studying finance to working as an engineer building data science products. I will attempt to give an answer here.

So, where to start? For those who‚Äôve read this far, I hope my personal story helps. It took me exactly 6 months to transition from a Banking and Finance student at Foreign Trade University to being qualified for a Data Mining Engineer position at Viettel.

There are three main points:

1. **Persistently build theoretical knowledge:** [Ultimate Learning Path to Becoming a Data Scientist in 2018](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/01/ultimate-learning-path-becoming-data-scientist-2018/)
2. **Learn and seek application opportunities simultaneously:** Let people around you KNOW you‚Äôre looking for problems to solve!
3. **Expand your network, find companions**

Once I decided I wanted to try data, I immediately looked for practical work to see if I really liked it. I chose an internship at a ‚Äúdata-driven‚Äù startup in the Business Analytics department. Meanwhile, I read and learned every day.

During the 3-month BA stint, I used a bit of my prior programming knowledge to solve some operational automation problems. When a newbie codes, they‚Äôre bound to hit roadblocks. Whenever stuck, I‚Äôd run to the tech room. The guys liked me, saying I was slow but eager to learn. I joined company discussions, shared my views, and indirectly announced I was learning about machine learning.

Luck was on my side. When the company decided to apply machine learning, I was the first to be asked. I got a spot in the tech team, tackled interesting yet basic problems, solved them, got them applied, then moved on to harder ones.

Then, the Entropy 2017 competition by John von Neumann Institute came up. It was perfect timing: I was revisiting Linear Algebra, applying Machine Learning to real problems, and finishing my thesis on Machine Learning. I was eager to see where I stood and meet industry folks. Everything aligned, and I made it to the finals. Top 10, the only non-engineering contestant. Wow, quite exciting.

This competition connected me with several organizations. I got some recognition, and thus, got hired

In conclusion, if you really want it, keep learning, let the world know about you, and stay alert for opportunities.
