We want to be the first to be aware of those issues, especially whenever we make any changes.

The next bit is related to our mindset. Sometimes we might need to think about whether we need 100% passed test cases in order to fix this new very urgent issue. For example, there are cases where if you fix some issues then the search result orderings of the other test cases might alter a bit. If we hard-code the rankings, then we might sweat ourselves trying to tweak our query template. But in practice a lot of the times we neither don’t need the ranking to be exactly pre-defined nor we are perfectly sure about which ordering is actually optimal. We should consider using a soft mechanism where we quantify the relevance of the system and using threshold instead.\n",

        "Before start designing a new query template, we can take a step back and really think about how we should model the search engine. Below are the essentials:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Exact matching will always surface on top of not-exact ones like fuzzy matching;\n",
        "2.  Exact matches does not take into account field length or word/document frequencies. If two documents have the same exact match in a field, they should have the same keyword matching score;\n",
        "3.  Within the same level of matching (whether exact or fuzzy), while the initial keyword matching scores should be the same, they can be reranked by certain modifiers such as distance, popularity, … However, the modified scores should not make the final score to exceed the base score of the upper level, e.g. modifed fuzzy score should not be greater than exact base score. This is to ensure the essential #1.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you watch football, this is similar to how the leagues such as Premiere League rank their teams. No matter how much more goals the team L has scored compared to team M’s or their head-to-head results, if team M has more points than team M has a higher ranking. The other measures are for tie-breaker only.\n",
        "\n",
        "This understanding can be then transferred to how we use Elasticsearch to express our model.\n",
        "\n",
        "One approach is to use `dis_max` query combined with `constant_score` query. The idea is to categorize each type of matching into different levels of score where one level will have twice the score of the below level. The documents fall into one level of matching (tie) will be reranked by modifiers but eventually the new scores will not exceed the upper base score. Here is the new query template:\n",
