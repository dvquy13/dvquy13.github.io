Some people work 60 hours a week and seem energized by it. Meanwhile, squeezing 10 extra hours out of your week for things you supposedly care about feels like climbing a mountain.

What's the difference?

It's not discipline. It's not willpower. It's enjoyment.

Those people enjoy their work. Every hour feeds them rather than drains them. You, on the other hand, are fighting yourself just to get started.

I've been on both sides. I know what it feels like to dread the work session you planned for yourself. I also know what it feels like to look up at the clock and realize three hours vanished while you were deep in something you cared about.

The difference came down to one thing: how I structured those sessions. Not how long, but how I started them.
