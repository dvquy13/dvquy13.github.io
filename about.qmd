Hi, I'm Quyâ€”an Applied Data Scientist. I blog about [RecSys](/posts.html#category=recsys), [LLM](/posts.html#category=llm), [ML](/posts.html#category=machine%20learning), [Productivity](/posts.html#category=productivity) and other random things.

Here are some of my [side projects](/projects.html) regarding the above topics.

I spend most of my other free time in football and DotA. Recently I started to learn badminton but damn this sport is hard.

I'm from Hanoi, Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³. Currently living in Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬.
