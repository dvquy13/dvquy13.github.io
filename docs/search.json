We’ll dive deep into the rationales behind sequence-based recommendation models and explore the design decisions that make them effective.\nThese models excel at understanding the temporal patterns hidden in user behavior. Instead of just knowing that a user liked certain books, our model will learn to recognize meaningful sequences. For example, when someone browses “Python Programming” followed by “Machine Learning,” the model understands they might be interested in “Deep Learning with PyTorch” next.\nThis is going to be a long post.

    "text": "Why Sequence Modeling Matters in Recommendations\nTraditional collaborative filtering approaches treat user preferences as static snapshots. They might know that User A liked Items 1, 3, and 7, but they miss the story hidden in the order and timing of these interactions.\nConsider these two users with identical item preferences but different behavioral patterns:\nUser A: Book1 → Book2 → Book3 → Book4 → Book5\nUser B: Book5 → Book1 → Book4 → Book2 → Book3\nBoth users interacted with the same five books, but their sequences tell very different stories. User A might be following a structured learning path (beginner to advanced), while User B might be jumping between topics based on immediate curiosity. Traditional collaborative filtering would treat these users identically, but sequence models can capture these nuanced patterns.\nThe even-more-compelling part about this our sequential model is that it gives you two very strong arguments to argue with: real-time adaptation and cold start handling.\nThink about what happens in static recommendation systems when new users sign up. They get the same boring popular items everyone else sees. “Here are the top 10 books everyone’s reading!” It’s like walking into a bookstore and having the clerk hand you a list without asking what you’re interested in. The user has to suffer through generic recommendations until the system has enough data about them. This is the cold start problem, which is, trust me, a real typical ask your Product Manager would come up during your recommendation model pitch.\nOur sequence model flips this on its head. The moment a new user clicks on their first book, the model springs into action. They browse “Python Programming,” then click on “Machine Learning Basics”—the model immediately understands they’re on a learning journey. The system starts personalizing from interaction number one, like having a shop assistant who gets better at helping you the longer you browse.\nAnd all of this happens without retraining the model or updating any databases as is required from the traditional collaborative filtering approaches, dealing with one of the biggest problems in recommendation systems: how do you stay relevant when user interests change quickly? If thriller readers suddenly start buying romance novels (maybe it’s Valentine’s Day), the model notices the shift in the very next recommendation request.\nI hope that now we all understand why sequence modeling is useful. Let’s explore how to actually design it."

    "section": "Sequence Modeling Approaches",
    "text": "Sequence Modeling Approaches\nThe central challenge in sequence modeling boils down to one question: how do you take a bunch of user interactions and turn them into something expressive for predictions? You have a sequence like “Book A → Book B → Book C” and somehow need to compress all that information into a representation that captures what the user is really interested in.\nI like to think of this as a “pooling” problem. You’re pooling information from multiple items into a single representation. It’s like trying to summarize a conversation—you want to keep the important bits and throw away the noise.\nThe simplest pooling method is averaging. But wait, you might think, average what exactly? We’re talking about sequences of item IDs that users clicked on. You can’t just average “book_123” and “book_456” like they’re numbers, right?\nThis is where you would want to know about the method of embedding. It converts every item in your catalog into a vector of numbers. Instead of working with raw item IDs, your model works with these dense numerical representations. It’s the same trick that made Word2Vec so powerful—remember from Chapter 3 how it could tell you that “king” minus “man” plus “woman” equals “queen”1? That magic happens because words become vectors, and vectors can be manipulated mathematically.\nSo when we talk about averaging a book sequence, we’re actually averaging the its corresponding item embeddings. Both Book A and Book B become 128-dimensional vectors, and averaging them gives you a single 128-dimensional output that somehow captures the essence of “someone who reads both Book A and Book B.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[\"User Sequence:&lt;br/&gt;book_123 → book_456 → book_789\"] --&gt; B[\"Item Embedding Layer\"]\n    \n    B --&gt; C[\"book_123&lt;br/&gt;[0.2, -0.1, 0.8, 0.3, ...]&lt;br/&gt;(128-dimensional vector)\"]\n    B --&gt; D[\"book_456&lt;br/&gt;[-0.3, 0.5, 0.1, -0.2, ...]&lt;br/&gt;(128-dimensional vector)\"]\n    B --&gt; E[\"book_789&lt;br/&gt;[0.1, 0.3, -0.4, 0.6, ...]&lt;br/&gt;(128-dimensional vector)\"]\n    \n    C --&gt; F[\"Average Pooling\"]\n    D --&gt; F\n    E --&gt; F\n    \n    F --&gt; G[\"Sequence Representation&lt;br/&gt;[-0.03, 0.23, 0.17, 0.23, ...]&lt;br/&gt;(128-dimensional vector)\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beautiful thing about embeddings, just like in ML in general, is that they can start random but learn to be meaningful. During training, the model adjusts these vectors so that similar items end up close together in the embedding space. Books about Python programming cluster together, romance novels form their own neighborhood, and so on.\nIt worths mentioning that averaging2 is wonderfully simple, and sometimes simplicity wins. I’ve seen myself trying other pooling methods only to discover that good old averaging works just as well. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t experiment. Some sequences have patterns that averaging destroys—like the difference between reading “Beginner Python → Advanced Python” versus “Advanced Python → Beginner Python”.\nThis is where more sophisticated pooling methods come in. The field of sequence modeling offers several architectural choices, each with its own strengths and trade-offs. The simplest approach uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which process sequences step by step, maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous steps. Think of an RNN as reading a book one page at a time, trying to remember everything important from earlier pages. While this sounds intuitive, vanilla RNNs have a memory problem—they forget important details from way back in the sequence, what researchers call the vanishing gradient problem.\nTo fix this memory issue, researchers developed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks. These use clever gating mechanisms to decide what to remember and what to forget. GRUs, in particular, have become the go-to choice for recommendation systems. They’re simpler than LSTMs but perform just as well—like getting 90% of the benefit with 60% of the complexity.\nMore recently, Transformer models have taken the field by storm. Instead of processing sequences step by step, they use self-attention mechanisms to look at all parts of the sequence simultaneously. It’s like being able to read an entire book at once and instantly connect themes from chapter 1 to chapter 20. Transformers are incredibly powerful for capturing long-range dependencies, but there’s a catch—they can be computationally expensive, especially when you have thousands or millions of items in your catalog.\nNow that we’ve explored different sequence modeling approaches—from simple averaging to sophisticated Transformers—let’s not forget that all architecture decisions should consider the following question: how do we deploy these models in production systems that need to handle millions of items in real-time?"

    "section": "Retrieval vs Ranking",
    "text": "Retrieval vs Ranking\nIntuitively, we need to score all items before being able to rank the most relevant and likely-to-be-interacted items on top. But training a scoring model that takes into account each instance of &lt;user, context, item&gt; and serving it for every online request is not feasible because of latency constraints. This act of calculating the scores for millions of items would take forever, and neither our users have that kind of patience nor do we as engineers find that idea sane.\n\nThe Two-Phase Architecture\nTo deal with this problem, we break the whole ranking process into two phases: first we quickly retrieve a candidate shortlist, then we ask a fine-grained ranker to give the final ranking.\nThe difference in naming between these two phases already reveals their distinct characteristics. The retrieval phase needs to quickly scan millions of items to find about 1,000 potential candidates in milliseconds. This speed requirement means it cannot use complex computations and often needs to leverage indexing structures like vector databases for fast similarity search. The focus here is on recall—ensuring that relevant items make it into the candidate set, even if the initial scoring isn’t perfect.\nThe ranking phase operates under very different constraints. With bandwidth and a much more limited scope of hundreds to thousands of items, it can afford to adopt many more signals and complex features into its model. This phase delivers much better fine-grained scores for final ordering, focusing on precision—getting the order exactly right among the candidates that have already been deemed potentially relevant.\n\n\n\n\nYan, Ziyou. (Jun 2021). System Design for Recommendations and Search.\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieval as a Standalone System\nOne important thing to note: apart from returning the candidates, most of the time the retrieval phase can provide scores to indicate how well they match the query. This in fact leads us to an interesting question: Why don’t we just use this signal as a final ranking to show to users?\nOne obvious argument is that this approach allows us to go to production earlier. Instead of taking months to build a more complete multi-stage system, we get to deploy a working version early, and hence enable early impacts.\nMore importantly, after the retrieval model is deployed, you start collecting actual interaction data from users engaging with your recommendations. Compare to the historical transaction data, this is a much more valuable feedback to help us further tune the rankings, in both quality and quantity. We have user’s direct feedback to our recommendations by observing which items get clicked/purchased and which ones don’t. And there are just much more data points.\nConsider this example of the rich feedback data we can gather:\n\n\n\nUser-Recommendation interaction logs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrec_id\nuser_id\ntimestamp\nrecommended_items\nviewed\nclicked\nconverted\n\n\n\n\nrec_001\nuser_123\n2025-05-31 10:30\n[Python_Basics, ML_Intro, Data_Analysis]\nPython_Basics, ML_Intro\nPython_Basics\nPython_Basics\n\n\nrec_002\nuser_456\n2025-05-31 11:45\n[Romance_Novel, Thriller, Biography]\nRomance_Novel, Thriller\nRomance_Novel\n-\n\n\nrec_004\nuser_123\n2025-05-31 16:00\n[Advanced_Python, Deep_Learning, Statistics]\nAdvanced_Python, Deep_Learning\nAdvanced_Python, Deep_Learning\nDeep_Learning\n\n\n\n\n\nFor user_123, we see a clear learning progression—they converted on both Python_Basics and Deep_Learning, suggesting our sequence modeling is capturing meaningful patterns. User_456 clicked on Romance_Novel but didn’t convert, giving us valuable signal about engagement without satisfaction.\nTo train a ranking model, we’d explode this data into item-level training examples with binary labels:\n\n\nItem-level training data for ranking models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrec_id\nuser_id\ntimestamp\nitem\nviewed\nclicked\nconverted\n\n\n\n\nrec_001\nuser_123\n2025-05-31 10:30\nPython_Basics\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nrec_001\nuser_123\n2025-05-31 10:30\nML_Intro\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nrec_001\nuser_123\n2025-05-31 10:30\nData_Analysis\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nrec_002\nuser_456\n2025-05-31 11:45\nRomance_Novel\n1\n1\n0\n\n\nrec_002\nuser_456\n2025-05-31 11:45\nThriller\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nrec_002\nuser_456\n2025-05-31 11:45\nBiography\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nrec_004\nuser_123\n2025-05-31 16:00\nAdvanced_Python\n1\n1\n0\n\n\nrec_004\nuser_123\n2025-05-31 16:00\nDeep_Learning\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nrec_004\nuser_123\n2025-05-31 16:00\nStatistics\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\nEach row represents a &lt;user, context, item&gt; tuple with explicit binary labels. This format captures the full engagement funnel—some items aren’t even viewed (viewed=0), others are seen but not clicked, and a few drive conversions. This multi-level feedback is crucial for training ranking models that understand both what catches users’ attention and what actually satisfies their needs. And the best part is that we don’t have to worry about negative sampling!\nFinally, by starting with retrieval alone, we can build our serving and monitoring infrastructure incrementally—learning to handle recommendation traffic, monitor model performance, and debug issues at manageable scale before adding the complexity of a ranking layer.\n\n\nOur Two-Tower Retriever\nIn that spirit, the implementation of our sequential recommendation model in this series is a retrieval-based one. It follows a typical Two Tower architecture, where the query tower embeds information about the user and context—in our case, the user’s sequence of interactions—while the candidate tower represents the candidate items.\nThis separation is necessary for efficient serving. The candidate tower can precompute embeddings for all items and store them in a vector index. The query tower only needs to run at request time to generate the user’s current context embedding.\n\n\n\nTraining Setup\nThe labels for training come from our preparation in previous chapters. We create positive instances from &lt;user, context, item&gt; tuples which have actual interaction records in the past, while negative examples are sampled from the unseen item space for each user-context pair. This creates a binary classification problem where the model learns to distinguish between items a user would interact with versus items they would ignore.\n\n\nServing Architecture\nFor serving, our retrieval system works in two phases. First, in an offline process, we index all candidate item embeddings in a nearest neighbor vector search system. Then, during online serving, we send the &lt;user, context&gt; as input to the query tower to get a query embedding vector, use similarity lookup to search for the nearest candidate neighbors in the index, and return the corresponding items with their similarity scores.\n\n\n\n\nRetrieval-only system\n\n\n\nThis architecture enables low-latency response times even when searching through millions of items, making it practical for recommendation serving.\nAgain, the beauty of this approach is that it’s both a complete recommendation system on its own and a foundation for the more fine-grained ranking models. You can deploy it immediately to start serving personalized recommendations, then later add a ranking layer on top without changing the underlying retrieval infrastructure."

    "text": "Model Implementation\nNow let’s translate the two-tower architecture into concrete code. But first, let me explain a key design decision that shapes our implementation.\n\nThe Case for Session-Only Models\nTraditional two-tower retrievers include both user embeddings and sequence representations in the query tower. But I’ve chosen to build what I call a “SoleSequenceRetriever”—a model that relies entirely on the sequence of interactions, without any user-specific embeddings.\nThis isn’t just a technical choice; it’s a strategic one3 that fundamentally changes how the model behaves. By removing user embeddings, we’re making a bet that the sequence itself contains enough signal to make good recommendations. A user browsing “Python Programming → Machine Learning → Data Analysis” tells us more about their immediate intent than knowing they’re “User #47832” with some historical preference profile.\nThis approach solves several practical problems. New users get meaningful recommendations from their very first interaction—no cold start period where they see generic popular items. Operationally, serving becomes a bit simpler since we don’t need to manage user embedding lookups or worry about user ID mapping issues.\n\n\nCore Architecture\nWith that context, let’s look at our implementation.\n\n\nsrc/sequence/model.py\n\nclass SoleSequenceRetriever(BaseSequenceRetriever):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        num_items: int,\n        embedding_dim: int,\n        pooling_method: str = \"mean\",\n        dropout: float = 0.2,\n        mask_pooling: bool = True,\n    ):\n        self.num_items = num_items\n        self.embedding_dim = embedding_dim\n        self.pooling_method = pooling_method.lower()\n        self.mask_pooling = mask_pooling\n\n        if item_embedding is None:\n            self.item_embedding = nn.Embedding(\n                num_items + 1,  # extra index for unknown/padding\n                embedding_dim,\n                padding_idx=num_items,\n            )\n        else:\n1            self.item_embedding = item_embedding\n\n        if self.pooling_method == \"gru\":\n            self.gru = nn.GRU(embedding_dim, embedding_dim, batch_first=True)\n        elif self.pooling_method == \"mean\":\n            self.gru = None\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid pooling_method. Choose 'gru' or 'mean'.\")\n\n        self.query_fc = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(embedding_dim, embedding_dim),\n            nn.BatchNorm1d(embedding_dim),\n            nn.Dropout(dropout),\n        )\n\n\n1\n\nWe support pre-trained item embeddings, which can be useful if you have embeddings from other models or external sources.\n\n\nThe architecture reflects our key principles. The item embedding layer converts raw item IDs into dense vectors that can capture semantic relationships. The configurable pooling method (mean or GRU) aggregates the sequence into a single representation. The fully connected layer in the query tower adds learning capacity while batch normalization and dropout help with generalization.\nNotice what’s not here: any mention of user IDs. The model’s query tower depends entirely on the sequence of items, making it truly session-based."

This choice of cosine similarity isn’t arbitrary—it aligns with how we’ll serve the model using nearest neighbor search in production, i.e. we perform the exact same similarity computation, just against pre-indexed candidate embeddings rather than individual examples.\n\n\nsrc/sequence/model.py\n\nclass SoleSequenceRetriever(BaseSequenceRetriever):\n    # ...\n\n    def get_query_embeddings(self, inputs: Dict[str, torch.Tensor]) -&gt; torch.Tensor:\n1        item_seq = inputs.get(\"item_seq\")\n        if item_seq is None:\n            raise ValueError(\"Missing required input key: 'item_seq'\")\n        item_seq = self.replace_neg_one_with_padding(item_seq)\n        mask = item_seq != self.item_embedding.padding_idx\n        seq_embeds = self.item_embedding(item_seq)\n        # Pool the sequence; the method will decide whether to use the mask based on self.mask_pooling\n        seq_rep = self.pool_sequence(seq_embeds, mask)\n        query_embedding = self.query_fc(seq_rep)\n        return F.normalize(query_embedding, p=2, dim=1)\n\n    def forward(self, inputs):\n        query_embedding = self.get_query_embeddings(inputs)      \n        candidate_embedding = self.get_candidate_embeddings(inputs)  \n        \n        query_embedding = F.normalize(query_embedding, p=2, dim=1)\n        candidate_embedding = F.normalize(candidate_embedding, p=2, dim=1)\n        cos_sim = torch.sum(query_embedding * candidate_embedding, dim=1)\n        \n        return (cos_sim + 1) / 2  # Scale to [0,1] since cosine similarity is in [-1, 1]\n\n\n1\n\nNote how we only need the item_seq from the inputs dict. This handles the cold start problem—new users immediately get meaningful recommendations based solely on their current session, without needing historical preference data.\n\n\n\nMask Pooling\nOne challenge we need to address: variable sequence lengths. In practice, users have different numbers of interactions—some might have browsed 3 books, others 15. To batch these sequences efficiently for training, we need to pad shorter sequences to a fixed length. We do this by filling empty positions with a special padding token (typically -1).\nMasked pooling can help us deal with this issue. Without masking, our pooling operations would include these padding tokens in their calculations, diluting the actual sequence representation. For mean pooling, averaging real embeddings with padding embeddings would give us a less meaningful representation. For GRU pooling, the model might learn spurious patterns from the padding tokens.\nBy implementing masked pooling, we tell the model to ignore these -1 padding tokens during sequence aggregation. The mask ensures that only genuine user interactions contribute to the final sequence representation, preserving the integrity of the learned patterns.\n\n\nsrc/sequence/model.py\n\nclass SoleSequenceRetriever(BaseSequenceRetriever):\n    # ...\n\n    def pool_sequence(self, seq_embeds: torch.Tensor, mask: torch.Tensor = None) -&gt; torch.Tensor:\n        if self.mask_pooling and mask is not None:\n            if self.pooling_method == \"gru\":\n                lengths = mask.sum(dim=1).clamp(min=1)\n                packed_seq = nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence(\n                    seq_embeds, lengths.cpu(), batch_first=True, enforce_sorted=False\n                )\n                _, hidden_state = self.gru(packed_seq)\n                return hidden_state.squeeze(0)\n            elif self.pooling_method == \"mean\":\n                mask_float = mask.unsqueeze(-1).float()\n                sum_embeds = (seq_embeds * mask_float).sum(dim=1)\n                count = mask_float.sum(dim=1).clamp(min=1)\n                return sum_embeds / count\n\nAs with other ideas, feel free to experiment with using masked pooling or not. It may sound like a good idea but not always lead to noticeable improvements according to my experience.\n\n\nTraining Loop\nThe training function uses binary cross-entropy loss against our positive/negative samples. We use PyTorch Lightning to leverage its built-in training loop, logging capabilities and integration with MLflow instead of implementing ourselves4.\n\n\nsrc/sequence/trainer.py\n\nclass LitSequenceRetriever(L.LightningModule):\n    # ...\n\n    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):\n        # Get model's predictions\n        predictions = self.model({\n            \"user_ids\": batch[\"user\"],\n            \"item_seq\": batch[\"item_sequence\"], \n            \"candidate_items\": batch[\"item\"]\n        })\n        \n        # Compare to actual user behavior\n        labels = batch[\"rating\"].float()\n        loss = nn.BCELoss()(predictions, labels)\n        \n        # This loss drives the learning process\n        return loss\n\n\n\nPreparing PyTorch Datasets\nPyTorch models work best with PyTorch datasets. Our UserItemRatingDFDataset class handles the conversion from pandas DataFrames to PyTorch tensors:\n\n\nsrc/dataset.py\n\nclass UserItemRatingDFDataset(Dataset):\n    def __init__(self, df, user_col: str, item_col: str, rating_col: str, timestamp_col: str):\n        self.df = df.assign(\n            **{rating_col: (df[rating_col] / MAX_RATING).astype(np.float32)}  # Normalize rating to [0,1]\n        )\n    \n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\n        return dict(\n            user=torch.as_tensor(self.df[self.user_col].iloc[idx]),\n            item=torch.as_tensor(self.df[self.item_col].iloc[idx]),\n            rating=torch.as_tensor(self.df[self.rating_col].iloc[idx]),\n            item_sequence=torch.tensor(self.df[\"item_sequence\"].iloc[idx], dtype=torch.long),\n        )\n\nThis dataset is then wrapped into a PyTorch DataLoader for batching and shuffling.\ntrain_loader = DataLoader(\n    train_dataset,\n    batch_size=batch_size,\n    shuffle=True,\n    num_workers=2,\n)"

    "text": "Model Comparison\nAfter training, we can compare the performance of our model with the popularity baseline:\n\n\n\nThe results validate our sequence-based approach with substantial improvements across all metrics. Let’s break down what these numbers tell us about our retrieval system’s effectiveness.\n\nRecall\nSince we’re building a retrieval system, recall is chosen to be our north-star metric. Recall measures what fraction of relevant items we successfully include in our candidate set. In the two-stage retrieval-ranking framework, if our retrieval system misses a relevant item, no amount of sophisticated ranking can fix that—the item is gone forever from the user’s recommendations.\nOur sequence-based model achieves significant improvements in recall across thresholds:\n\nRecall@100: 0.186 vs 0.062 (197% improvement)\nRecall@10: 0.038 vs 0.01 for the popularity baseline (280% improvement)\n\nThese numbers tell two important stories. Assuming we would send hundreds of candidates as the output to the later ranking stage, the recall@100 improvement shows we’re nearly doubling our ability to capture relevant items in a typical retrieval pass. This is crucial for the downstream ranking stage—we’re giving it much better raw material to work with.\nThe recall@10 improvement indicates positive sign but for a different reason. When we deploy this retrieval system as a standalone recommender (without a ranking stage), users see these top-10 results directly. A 280% improvement means users are nearly three times more likely to find something relevant in their immediate recommendations.\n\n\nRanking Quality Validation\nHowever, when talking about the end-result ranking for users, NDCG tells a more complete story. The significant improvements in NDCG ranking metrics provide additional validation: NDCG@10: 0.018 vs 0.005 (360% improvement). NDCG measures whether we’re putting the most relevant items at the top of our candidate list. This improvement suggests our retrieval system isn’t just finding relevant items—it’s finding them and scoring them appropriately.\nThis ranking quality matters regardless of whether we add a downstream ranking stage. If we deploy the retrieval system directly, users get better-ordered recommendations. If we add ranking later, we’re providing the ranking model with better-scored candidates to work with.\n\n\nWhat This Means for Users\nThese metric improvements translate to concrete user experience benefits:\n\nImmediate Impact: Users are 3x more likely to find relevant items in their top recommendations, dramatically reducing the time spent browsing through irrelevant suggestions.\nBetter Cold Start: New users get personalized recommendations from their very first interaction, eliminating the typical cold start period of generic popular items.\nSystem Flexibility: The improved candidate quality gives us options—we can deploy this as a complete recommendation system now, or use it as a strong foundation for a more sophisticated ranking stage later.\n\nThe results demonstrate that sequence modeling captures meaningful patterns in user behavior that static approaches miss entirely.\nThat said, while the uplifts are strong, the absolute numbers are still low. This is expected since we haven’t really optimized the model, so keep in mind that this is just the beginning. But if you ask me what high or good numbers look like, I would say this kind of improvement is already sufficient for us to deploy in production, given that this is the starting point."

Here’s what we accomplished:\nFrom Theory to Practice:\n\nWhy sequence modeling matters: We established that traditional collaborative filtering misses the story hidden in the order and timing of user interactions. By modeling sequences, we can distinguish between users who follow structured learning paths versus those who jump between topics randomly.\nReal-time adaptation and cold start solutions: We demonstrated how sequence-based models solve two critical RecSys challenges. New users get personalized recommendations from their very first interaction, and the model adapts immediately to changing user interests without requiring retraining.\n\nArchitectural Decisions:\n\nTwo-tower retrieval architecture: We chose a retrieval-focused approach over end-to-end ranking, enabling fast candidate selection from millions of items while maintaining millisecond-level response times.\nSession-only modeling: By building a “SoleSequenceRetriever” that relies entirely on interaction sequences without user embeddings, we prioritized adaptability and simplified serving infrastructure while solving cold start problems elegantly.\n\nTechnical Implementation:\n\nMasked pooling for variable sequences: We addressed the practical challenge of variable-length user sessions by implementing masked pooling that ignores padding tokens during sequence aggregation.\nCosine similarity alignment: Our training objective uses the same cosine similarity computation as production serving, ensuring consistency between offline training and online inference.\nPyTorch Lightning integration: We leveraged Lightning’s capabilities for training loops, distributed training, and automatic MLflow integration, avoiding the complexity of custom implementations.\n\nValidation and Results:\n\nSubstantial performance improvements: Our sequence-based retriever achieved 197% improvement in Recall@100 and 280% improvement in Recall@10 compared to the popularity baseline, demonstrating that temporal patterns contain meaningful signals for recommendations.\nMLflow model registry: We established automated model versioning with quality gates, ensuring only models exceeding minimum performance thresholds get registered for potential deployment.\n\nLast but not least, we spent an entire section discussing why whis sequence-based retriever represents a complete, deployable recommendation system that can serve personalized suggestions in real-time. More importantly, it provides a solid foundation for future enhancements—whether adding a downstream ranking layer or incorporating additional features like item content or user demographics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\nAll code for this chapter is available in the notebooks/011-sequence-modeling.ipynb file and the src/sequence/ directory in the project repository."

    "text": "Introduction\nIn Chapter 2, we dug into our Amazon dataset and built a solid feature preprocessing pipeline. But we’re not ready to train any models yet. We’re missing something crucial: the labels that will teach our model the difference between what users want and what they don’t.\nWe already know which books users bought and when. Here comes a natural way to frame ours as a Machine Learning problem: Show the model a user’s past actions, then ask it to predict he’s going to read next.\nIf you keep an eye on the progress of ML in the last 15 years, you should find this idea of predicting next item based on a sequence of items familiar. This is how Tomas Mikolov and his colleagues at Google developed their influential Word2Vec model. Word2Vec is a simple but brilliant architecture that learns word relationships by studying which words hang out together. It breaks a sentence into input-output pairs where the surrounding words are the input and the hidden target word is what you’re trying to predict.\n\n\n\nSource: A simple Word2Vec tutorial\n\n\nAt each step, we pick a target word along with its neighboring context to form a positive training example.\nHow about the negatives?\nIf positives are observed from the surrounding context of a target word X, negatives are sampled by throwing in some randomly selected words which we haven’t found appear close to X. This mix challenges the model, teaching it to learn the patterns of words that appear in similar contexts.\nTake an e-commerce business as an example. When a user clicks, views, or buys something, that’s a clear positive signal. But what about the millions of items they never touch? Are these items bad, or did the user just never discover them? These are the sorts of “negative” examples—where we assume that most of which he probably won’t pick.\nWhen thinking about the importance of negative sampling, I personally find this analogy helpful: Training a recommendation model without negative samples is like teaching someone to recognize cats by only showing them cat pictures. They might think everything is a cat!\n\nGiven that, let’s put some thoughts into different ways we can actually generate negative samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\nAll code for this chapter is in notebooks/002-negative-sample.ipynb and src/negative_sampling.py in the project repository."

    "section": "Negative Sampling Strategies",
    "text": "Negative Sampling Strategies\n\nRandom Sampling\nLet’s start with the obvious approach: just pick random items the user hasn’t touched.\nThis is faily straightforward to code up. You grab all the items a user hasn’t interacted with, throw them in a hat, and pull out however many negatives you need. It’s fast, it’s unbiased, and it works.\nBut there’s a problem. Some of those “random” negatives might actually be items the user would love if they found them. There’s also another issue: the model might get biased toward popular items, since they show up in lots of positive pairs.\n\n\nPopularity-Based Sampling\nTo deal with the above popularity bias, instead of picking negatives randomly, we sample them based on how popular they are in the dataset. This makes popular items get chosen as negatives more often.\nHow does this help? A popular item has a higher chance of being liked by any user than a random item. So when we use popular items as negatives, we’re creating harder training examples. We’re forcing the model to learn why this specific user didn’t interact with this popular item, even though lots of other people did.\nThe downside? It requires more effort to implement, like tracking popularity statistics when doing sampling. And sometimes it’s true that popular items aren’t always bad choices for a user. They are often top-selling because they’re actually good.\n\n\nHard Negative Mining\nThis is the fancy approach. You need a model that’s already somewhat trained, and you use it to find items it thinks a user would like—but shouldn’t. These become your negative samples.\nIt’s like having a sparring partner who knows your weaknesses. The model keeps getting challenged by examples that are specifically designed to trip it up. As the model gets better, the negatives get harder, creating a virtuous cycle of improvement.\nSounds great, right? But it’s not always worth the extra effort, especially at the start. You need to train iteratively, which takes more time and compute. And there’s always the risk that you’re just teaching the model to overfit to its own biases.\nFor this project, we’ll use popularity-based negative sampling. It strikes a good balance between effectiveness and simplicity."

Here’s what we covered:\n\nWhy we need negative samples: Without them, our model would be like someone trying to recognize cats by only seeing cat pictures. We need examples of what users don’t want to create balanced learning.\nThree approaches to negative sampling: We looked at random sampling (simple but not very challenging), popularity-based sampling (our chosen approach that creates harder training scenarios), and hard negative mining (powerful but complex).\nOur popularity-based implementation: We built a system that samples negative items based on their popularity. This forces our model to learn why a user didn’t interact with popular items that others liked.\nKeeping things balanced: We generate equal numbers of positive and negative samples for each user (1:1 ratio) to avoid bias in either direction.\nAdding realistic features: We make sure our negative samples have proper timestamps and features that align with when users were actually active. This maintains temporal consistency for sequence modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\nAll code for this chapter is in notebooks/002-negative-sample.ipynb and src/negative_sampling.py in the project repository."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nImagine you’re browsing an e-commerce site and notice something very interesting: the recommendations update almost instantly as you click through products. You view a pair of headphones, and suddenly phone cases, audio cables, and portable chargers appear. You check out a laptop, and the “you might also like” section refreshes with wireless mice, laptop bags, and USB hubs. You think to yourself—How do they capture your evolving intent so quickly? How do they serve personalized suggestions fast enough to feel real-time? How do they handle the complexity of understanding your browsing patterns on the fly?\nIf you’ve ever have those questions, this tutorial series is for you.\nOver the next 7 chapters, I’ll walk you through building an end-to-end recommendation system that reacts in real-time based on user behavior sequences. We’ll go from raw data to a complete recommender system that personalizes recommendations as users interact with your platform. The final product looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe Demo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnough Talking, Show Me the Code!\n\n\n\nIf you’re familiar with RecSys and just want to see the code, here it is: https://github.com/dvquy13/recsys-seq-model.\n\n\nA quick recap for those who aren’t well aware of what a recommender system is: Recommender systems are specialized tools designed to suggest items—whether products, content, or services—to users based on what we know about their preferences and behaviors. At their core, they comprise a set of technologies, algorithms, and processes that analyze user interaction signals (clicks, views, purchases, ratings, etc.) to predict what individual users might find relevant or engaging.\n\n\n\nFrom the user’s perspective, these systems help uncover content or products they might never have discovered on their own and save time by surfacing the most relevant options up front.\nFrom a business standpoint, the primary goals of a recommender system are to create a sense of “we understand you” for each user and to drive revenue through personalized cross-selling opportunities. By tailoring recommendations to each user, companies can boost engagement and average order value.\nIn practice, recommender systems power some of the world’s largest digital platforms. For example, Amazon’s “Frequently Bought Together” suggestions guide shoppers toward complementary products, Facebook uses recommendation algorithms to prioritize posts and ads in users’ feeds, and Netflix’s home screen is largely driven by personalized movie and show recommendations.\n\n\n\nThe impact of these systems is profound: According to this report from McKinsey, roughly 75 percent of Netflix viewing hours come from recommended titles, 35 percent of Amazon’s purchases are influenced by its recommendations, and Netflix alone saves around $1 billion per year through improved user retention and engagement. These metrics underscore why recommender systems have become a critical component of modern digital businesses."

    "section": "Session-Based vs Traditional Recommendations",
    "text": "Session-Based vs Traditional Recommendations\nTraditional recommendation systems often rely on collaborative filtering, which uses historical user-item interaction signals to find similar users or items. While effective, these approaches have limitations:\n\nStatic representations: User preferences are treated as fixed\nCold start problems: Difficulty with new users or items\nLimited temporal understanding: Doesn’t capture evolving user interests within a session\n\nSession-based recommendation systems take a fundamentally different approach by focusing on user behavior patterns within individual sessions or short time windows. Instead of building static user profiles from historical data, these systems analyze the sequence of actions a user takes during their current browsing session—the order they click through products, the time they spend on each item, and how their interests evolve in real-time.\nConsider a typical e-commerce browsing session that illustrates why this sequential understanding matters:\n\nUser searches for “wireless headphones”\nViews a Sony model\nChecks reviews for Audio-Technica alternatives\nCompares prices across brands\n\nEach step provides context for the next recommendation. Traditional systems might miss this sequential pattern and treat each interaction independently, while session-based models capture the evolving intent throughout the entire journey—understanding that the user is comparison shopping for headphones within a specific price range.\n\n\n\n\nThe signals we can leverage to deliver better recommenations\n\n\n\nIn essence, this approach addresses the limitations of traditional methods by:\n\nModeling sequences: Understanding the order and timing of user interactions\nCapturing short-term intent: Focusing on recent behaviors within a session\nHandling anonymity: Working even without persistent user identifiers\nReal-time adaptation: Continuously updating recommendations as users interact\n\nNow that we understand why session-based recommendations make sense, it might be tempting to jump straight into building one. But I would advise you to hold on, cause there’s still one big question we need to address: How do you ensure your model gets access to the data it needs? When talking about serving this kind of real-time model in production, even the most powerful one is useless if it can’t receive timely user interaction signals."

    "section": "A Simplified Payload Approach",
    "text": "A Simplified Payload Approach\nLarge-scale real-time recommendation engines are typically built on top of streaming architectures with event pipelines (Kafka, Kinesis, etc.) that process user interactions. The streaming system is normally managed in a centralized manner by a platform team with the aim to provide real-time data processing capabilities to multiple downstream usages. This approach also ensures scalability and reliability.\nHowever, for the purpose of this tutorial, we can relax the requirements of serving multiple use cases. This leaves us with more room to think about how we can approach getting real-time user signals. Why can’t we just ask our app client to store and directly provide us the recent user interactions as context whenever it requests our recommendation service?\nIf the answer is yes, then I have a name for our approach: The Simplied Payload.\nBasically we would attach the real-time events along with the requests coming to our RecSys APIs (in the payload—hence its name). In practice, this implementation can be done by frontend engineers capturing user interactions locally (clicks, views, etc.).\nWhile this approach looks like a hacky-workaround ways, I have seen teams using this in production for early-stage real-time ML RecSys. When really thinking about it, the idea has some merits in and of itself. They include (1) minimal signal delay, (2) users not needing to refresh to get updated recommendations and (3) easier to implement and debug. (4) User privacy is another reason worth considering.\nIn the below screenshot you can see that in the POST request payload sending to a recommendation endpoint, we include the recent user interacted item IDs in item_seq_raw in the payload.\n\n\n\n\nExample request payload"

Along with data prep, retrieval sits at the top of the pipeline so any improvements in these fronts is more likely to improve the overall system. Hit rate is chosen as a key metric because since we can employ rerank as a subsequent step, we have room to optimize for the ranking issues. \nFor response, Correctness measures both how relevant the answer is with respect to the query and how correct it is compared to the referenced answer. It’s therefore a better indicator than pure relevance, which is just based on the query and hence easier to get right.\nFor reference, Response Correctness on synthetic dataset has improved +166% from 1.75 / 5.00 from MVP version to 4.67 / 5.00 on the current version. The current Retrieval Hit Rate @ 50 reaches 73%, not directly comparable but at MVP version Retrieval Hit Rate @ 10 was 20%.\nAs next steps, while there is not much room to improve Response Correctness, we ought to increase Retrieval Hit Rate to 90% which should be doable since this dataset only contains a small amount of data."

Though still far from a great search engine, here are some things worth sharing in my opinion. More importantly, I want to get feedback about them.\nThis blog post is to provide an approach to design the Elasticsearch query template to deal with common site-search problems including searching for matches across different fields, boosting results and testing. Together we will identify issues with the default approach and then gradually come up with a new one to address the issues altogether.\nThis Github repo contains the examples and code discussed in this post."

We haven’t had much experience, but luckily the app does not require accuracy level of Google from the start. The key is to make gradual visible progresses!\nAlright, let’s dive into it. First off, we make sure user can search for restaurant by name. Here we can rely on the simple default query-match to get the job done.\n\n\nCode: Index our first two restaurants\n\nPOST _bulk\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"restaurant\", \"_id\" : \"001sabichuong\" } }\n{ \"restaurant_name\": \"Sa Bi Chuong\", \"cuisine\": \"Vietnamese\", \"rating\": 5.0 }\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"restaurant\", \"_id\" : \"002vietnamesephonoodle\" } }\n{ \"restaurant_name\": \"Vietnamese Pho Noodle\", \"cuisine\": \"Vietnamese\", \"rating\": 4.0 }\n\n# Test searching for one\n# Should return Vietnamese Pho Noodle\nGET restaurant/_search\n{\n  \"query\" : {\n    \"match\" : { \"restaurant_name\": \"vietnamese\" }\n  }\n}\n\nThe above snippet can be run at Kibana’s Dev Tools &gt; Console, which will be available at your localhost:5601 if you follow the repo.\nThe code is self-explained. We ask Elasticsearch to return restaurants whose name contains vietnamese. And we get back one result for Vietnamese Pho Noodle. No problems.\nBut we quickly find out that name is not the only place we want to look for when user submit a query. Given keywordvietnamese we should also return the restaurant Sa Bi Chuong, because it’s a Vietnamese restaurant as tagged in the cuisine. A multi_match query allows us to do exactly that.\n\n\nCode: Matching multiple fields\n\n# Should return all 2 Vietnamese restaurant with the Vietnamese Pho Noodle on top\nGET restaurant/_search\n{\n  \"query\" : {\n    \"multi_match\" : {\n      \"query\": \"vietnamese\",\n      \"fields\": [ \"restaurant_name\", \"cuisine\" ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\"hits\": {\n    ...\n    \"hits\": [\n      {\n        \"_index\": \"restaurant\",\n        \"_id\": \"002vietnamesephonoodle\",\n        \"_score\": 0.6931471,\n        \"_source\": {\n          \"restaurant_name\": \"Vietnamese Pho Noodle\",\n          \"cuisine\": \"Vietnamese\",\n          \"rating\": 4\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"_index\": \"restaurant\",\n        \"_id\": \"001sabichuong\",\n        \"_score\": 0.18232156,\n        \"_source\": {\n          \"restaurant_name\": \"Sa Bi Chuong\",\n          \"cuisine\": \"Vietnamese\",\n          \"rating\": 5\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }"

This is expected as the algorithm assumes that a keyword is a better signal if it is not common and usually found in a lot of documents (sort of a solution to automatically handle stopwords). In our examples, both the restaurants have cuisine Vietnamese so according to TFIDF, that match does not say much about the relevance of the documents.\nWhether we should encourage this behavior is a question. Is it true that having Vietnamese in the name make one restaurant more “Vietnamese” than the other?\nAnother problem with TFIDF is that it takes into account the length of the field.\n\n\nCode: Let’s add another restaurant\n\nPOST _bulk\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"restaurant\", \"_id\" : \"003vietnamesepho\" } }\n{ \"restaurant_name\": \"Vietnamese Pho\", \"cuisine\": \"Vietnamese\", \"rating\": 3.0 }\n\n# In the below example we see that the new Vietnamese Pho restaurant is ranked higher...\nGET restaurant/_search\n{\n  \"query\" : {\n    \"multi_match\" : {\n      \"query\": \"vietnamese pho\",\n      \"fields\": [ \"restaurant_name\", \"cuisine\" ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"explain\": true\n}\n\nYou can find the detailed and lengthy result in Appendix 1. In short, we see that the result ranks restaurant Vietnamese Pho first and then Vietnamese Pho Noodle. Analyzing the component scores indicates that the key difference is that Vietnamese Pho has length=2 (words) while Vietnamese Pho Noodle has length=3. It feels unintuitive since we know that the second restaurant has higher rating, given that both, in practice, are equally matching to user’s keyword."

Will it work for other cases?”. Indeed, that’s the question we should ask ourselves. Overtime, with more and more requirements, our query template will grow in complexity, leading to conflicts between the modifications we make.\nLet’s move to the next example to illustrate what I mean by “conflict”."

Elasticsearch has a built-in mechanism called fuzzy matching, which is configurable with the option fuzziness.\n\n\nCode: fuzzy matching\n\n# The use of `bool` query below is to implement the logic: At least one condition should match\nPUT _scripts/01-default-fuzzy-search-template\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"lang\": \"mustache\",\n    \"source\": {\n      \"query\": {\n        \"function_score\": {\n          \"query\": {\n            \"bool\": {\n              \"must\": [\n                {\n                  \"bool\": {\n                    \"should\": [\n                      {\n                        \"multi_match\" : {\n                          \"query\": \"{{query_string}}\",\n                          \"fields\": [ \"restaurant_name\", \"cuisine\" ]\n                        }\n                      },\n                      {\n                        \"multi_match\" : {\n                          \"query\": \"{{query_string}}\",\n                          \"fields\": [ \"restaurant_name\", \"cuisine\" ],\n                          # For the purpose of this demo, default behavior works well enough\n                          \"fuzziness\": \"AUTO\"\n                        }\n                      }\n                    ]\n                  }\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          \"functions\": [\n            {\n              \"filter\": {\n                \"range\": {\n                  \"rating\": {\n                    \"gte\": 5,\n                    \"lte\": 5\n                  }\n                }\n              },\n              \"weight\": 10\n            },\n            {\n              \"filter\": {\n                \"range\": {\n                  \"rating\": {\n                    \"gte\": 4,\n                    \"lt\": 5\n                  }\n                }\n              },\n              \"weight\": 2\n            }\n          ],\n          \"score_mode\": \"max\",\n          \"boost_mode\": \"multiply\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"params\": {\n      \"query_string\": \"My query string\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNotice that we just created a query template instead of running a query. We can now invoke the query with paramaters, which is a nice feature Elasticsearch introduces to make our code look less overwhelming. Like this:\nGET /_search/template\n{\n  \"id\": \"01-default-fuzzy-search-template\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"query_string\": \"vietnames\"\n  }\n}\nThe above query returns our expected Vietnamese restaurant given a typo keyword vietnames. Under the hood, fuzzy matching uses Levenshtein edit distance, which measures similarity between strings by the number of modifications one make to make one become another. In our example, we just need to add one letter e at the end to make vietnames become vietnamese. Quite an easy task for the algorithm. One might also argue that it’s quite easy for our developers as well. 2 lines of code and a new beautiful feature.\nWell, the interesting bit lies elsewhere. One day, our sales team suddenly comes to us with a complaint that search result is wrong. People are getting Japanese BBQ restaurants over Korean ones even when they explicitly search for kbbq (which is a common acronym for korean bbq).\nHere are the restaurants:\nPOST _bulk\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"restaurant\", \"_id\" : \"004parkhangseokbbq\" } }\n{ \"restaurant_name\": \"Park Hang-seo's KBBQ\", \"cuisine\": \"Korean\", \"rating\": 2.0 }\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"restaurant\", \"_id\" : \"005bestbbqintown\" } }\n{ \"restaurant_name\": \"Best BBQ in town\", \"cuisine\": \"Japanese\", \"rating\": 5.0 }\nQuery:\n{\n  \"id\": \"01-default-fuzzy-search-template\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"query_string\": \"kbbq\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nResult\n\n{\n  \"hits\": {\n    \"hits\": [\n      {\n        \"_index\": \"restaurant\",\n        \"_id\": \"005bestbbqintown\",\n        \"_score\": 8.384459,\n        \"_source\": {\n          \"restaurant_name\": \"Best BBQ in town\",\n          \"cuisine\": \"Japanese\",\n          \"rating\": 5\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"_index\": \"restaurant\",\n        \"_id\": \"004parkhangseokbbq\",\n        \"_score\": 2.5153382,\n        \"_source\": {\n          \"restaurant_name\": \"Park Hang-seo's KBBQ\",\n          \"cuisine\": \"Korean\",\n          \"rating\": 2\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nTo understand what is happening, we need to enable explain=true to see what contributes to the final scores. As this time the output is too verbose, here are the findings:\n\nThe keyword matching score (before boosting) for the Best BBQ in town restaurant is 0.8, less than the 1.2 of Park Hang-seo's KBBQ\nSo if no boosting applied, we will see Park Hang-seo's KBBQ restaurant ranks at the first position\nBut then the boosting from rating modifies the score, leading to the ordering as we can see\n\nOne way to frame the issue is that we have imperfect boosting. Say we have a better formula that strikes the right balances, then the problem should be solved. But it’s close to impossible to guarantee that the new formula will not cause any other issues. We don’t want these kinds of issue creep into the system without any notice and then some day being flagged out by stakeholders. We want to be the first to be aware of those issues, especially whenever we make any changes. Therefore, before discussing potential solutions, I hope we all agree that the very next important thing we should do is (yes, you are probably thinking about the same thing as I am) setting up a testing/evaluation mechanism."

    "text": "How should we create test cases for this search application?\nIMHO, the first challenge is about moving data. The queries and the documents can both grow over time, so a static mock dataset might not be a very good representative of the search relevance anymore after a month. The next bit is related to our mindset. Sometimes we might need to think about whether we need 100% passed test cases in order to fix this new very urgent issue. For example, there are cases where if you fix some issues then the search result orderings of the other test cases might alter a bit. If we hard-code the rankings, then we might sweat ourselves trying to tweak our query template. But in practice a lot of the times we neither don’t need the ranking to be exactly pre-defined nor we are perfectly sure about which ordering is actually optimal. We should consider using a soft mechanism where we quantify the relevance of the system and using threshold instead.\nHere we look at how we can use Elasticsearch Ranking Evaluation API to implement such evaluation scheme:\n\n\nCode: Evaluation API\n\nGET restaurant/_rank_eval\n{\n  # Query template comes in really handy when used in conjunction with _rank_eval\n  \"templates\": [\n     {\n        \"id\": \"01-default-fuzzy-search-template\",\n        \"template\": {\n            \"id\": \"01-default-fuzzy-search-template\"\n        }\n     }\n  ],\n  \"requests\": [\n    {\n     \"id\": \"kbbq_query\",\n     # Here we manually define the true positives with rating &gt;= 1.0\n     # The actual rating number helps when using metrics that takes into account\n     # the ranking of the search results\n     \"ratings\": [\n        { \"_index\": \"restaurant\", \"_id\": \"004parkhangseokbbq\", \"rating\": 3 },\n        { \"_index\": \"restaurant\", \"_id\": \"005bestbbqintown\", \"rating\": 1 }\n      ],\n     \"template_id\": \"01-default-fuzzy-search-template\",\n     \"params\": {\n        \"query_string\": \"kbbq\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n     \"id\": \"vietnamese_query\",\n     \"ratings\": [\n        { \"_index\": \"restaurant\", \"_id\": \"001sabichuong\", \"rating\": 3 },\n        { \"_index\": \"restaurant\", \"_id\": \"002vietnamesephonoodle\", \"rating\": 3 },\n        { \"_index\": \"restaurant\", \"_id\": \"003vietnamesepho\", \"rating\": 3 }\n      ],\n     \"template_id\": \"01-default-fuzzy-search-template\",\n     \"params\": {\n        \"query_string\": \"vietnamese\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metric\": {\n    \"dcg\": {\n      \"k\": 5,\n      \"normalize\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nResult\n\n{\n  \"metric_score\": 0.8549048706984328,  # This is the overall metric score, best is 1.0, worst is 0.0\n  \"details\": {\n    \"kbbq_query\": {\n      # This kbbq_query has a imperfect score because it ranks the more relevant result lower\n      \"metric_score\": 0.7098097413968655,\n      \"unrated_docs\": [],\n      \"hits\": [\n        {\n          \"hit\": {\n            \"_index\": \"restaurant\",\n            \"_id\": \"005bestbbqintown\",\n            \"_score\": 8.384459\n          },\n          \"rating\": 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"hit\": {\n            \"_index\": \"restaurant\",\n            \"_id\": \"004parkhangseokbbq\",\n            \"_score\": 2.5153382\n          },\n          \"rating\": 3\n        }\n      ],\n      \"metric_details\": {\n        ...\n      }\n    },\n    \"vietnamese_query\": {\n      \"metric_score\": 1,\n      \"unrated_docs\": [],\n      \"hits\": [\n        ...\n      ],\n      \"metric_details\": {\n        ...\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"failures\": {}\n}\n\nLet’s try to better our search by introducing changes that move the evaluation score closer to the perfect 1.0."

    "section": "Our revised search model",
    "text": "Our revised search model\nBefore start designing a new query template, we can take a step back and really think about how we should model the search engine. Below are the essentials:\n\nExact matching will always surface on top of not-exact ones like fuzzy matching;\nExact matches does not take into account field length or word/document frequencies. If two documents have the same exact match in a field, they should have the same keyword matching score;\nWithin the same level of matching (whether exact or fuzzy), while the initial keyword matching scores should be the same, they can be reranked by certain modifiers such as distance, popularity, … However, the modified scores should not make the final score to exceed the base score of the upper level, e.g. modifed fuzzy score should not be greater than exact base score. This is to ensure the essential #1.\n\nIf you watch football, this is similar to how the leagues such as Premiere League rank their teams. No matter how much more goals the team L has scored compared to team M’s or their head-to-head results, if team M has more points than team M has a higher ranking. The other measures are for tie-breaker only.\nThis understanding can be then transferred to how we use Elasticsearch to express our model.\nOne approach is to use dis_max query combined with constant_score query. The idea is to categorize each type of matching into different levels of score where one level will have twice the score of the below level. The documents fall into one level of matching (tie) will be reranked by modifiers but eventually the new scores will not exceed the upper base score. Here is the new query template:\n\n\nCode: New query template\n\nPUT _scripts/02-constant-score-search-template\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"lang\": \"mustache\",\n    \"source\": {\n      \"query\": {\n        \"function_score\": {\n          \"query\": {\n            \"bool\": {\n              \"must\": [\n                {\n                  \"bool\": {\n                    \"should\": [\n                      {\n                        # `dis_max` query gets the max score of an array of clauses\n                        \"dis_max\": {\n                          \"queries\": [\n                            {\n                              # `constant_score` says that if matches, return a constant score\n                              \"constant_score\": {\n                                \"filter\": {\n                                  \"multi_match\" : {\n                                    \"query\": \"{{query_string}}\",\n                                    \"fields\": [ \"restaurant_name\", \"cuisine\" ]\n                                  }\n                                },\n                                # This is the constant that is returned as score\n                                # Note that the exact number is chosen intentionally\n                                # Here the upper level will be twice the lower level\n                                # and we will restrict the modifiers to be only\n                                # able to boost by at most 100% the base score\n                                # so that the lower level can not exceed the upper\n                                \"boost\": 2\n                              }\n                            },\n                            {\n                              \"constant_score\": {\n                                \"filter\": {\n                                  \"multi_match\" : {\n                                    \"query\": \"{{query_string}}\",\n                                    \"fields\": [ \"restaurant_name\", \"cuisine\" ],\n                                    \"fuzziness\": \"AUTO\"\n                                  }\n                                },\n                                \"boost\": 1\n                              }\n                            }\n                          ]\n                        }\n                      }\n                    ]\n                  }\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          \"functions\": [\n            # Design the modifiers to be multiplier of maximum 1.9999 the base score\n            {\n              \"weight\": 1\n            },\n            {\n              \"field_value_factor\": {\n                \"field\": \"rating\",\n                \"modifier\": \"ln\",\n                \"missing\": 1\n              },\n              \"weight\": 0.1\n            }\n          ],\n          \"score_mode\": \"sum\",\n          \"boost_mode\": \"multiply\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"params\": {\n      \"query_string\": \"My query string\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWhen we re-run the evaluation, we can observe that the normalized DCG metric now has score equal to 1.0, denoting a perfect accuracy!"

    "text": "Objective\n\nHelp people spend more time working on the thing they consciously want, by presenting a systematic way called “The 30-min timebox” to warm up and bring in the motivation\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhy do we need to be mindful of how we spend our time?\nWhat prevents people from spending more time on what they consciously want (i.e. not being dragged by the monkey like in the Tim Urbun Wait but Why procrastination blog post)?\nHow did I realize that my typical scheduled 30-min work session can sometimes expand to hours?\nWhy does the 30-min timebox work?\n\n\n\nTime is the most precious resource that we have. Time is the most… Repeat 3 times after me.\nHow are you managing that precious resources?\nHave you ever wonder how people can spend 80 hours a week working while spending an extra 10 hours out of your 9-to-5 work seems already a big achievement for you?\nMy hypothesis: The difference is that those people enjoy every minute of those working hours, but you don’t. What other reasons can it be?\nYou might be thinking: Well those people are rare, and they are the lucky ones knowing what they want to do with their life. They have found their passions.\nAre you saying that you don’t know what to do with your life?\nDon’t be offended, I’m not here to tell you that everyone should have figured that out. What i’m trying to do is to filter the audiences. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time, and if you decide to read on, I hope you would find something useful for yourself.\nBecause It’s like tricking the monkey in your head. A lot of the time we only need the momentum to get going, once the momentum is there we the monkey would either join the play or would retreat. But the monkey is short sighted, so it often views the process of creating momentum very boring, which it disgusts.\nOne of the best ways to start the 30-min timebox is to focus on a specific question—a small enough one but just enough interesting to pique your inner interest. I have found starting the timebox by typing out the question and bulleting our thoughts is tremendously helpful. One question generally leads to others, and by the time you notice it has been 35 mins passed already.\nOkay, we committed to ourselves (or actually to our monkey) that we only work for 30 mins only. Now what? Shall we just find ourselves done with the work and go do other things?\nOf course you can. You have the right to respect your own words, even that being a promise making to an imaginary entity in our head. By doing so you creat trust in your own mind system, which I think is vital in maintaining a healthy engine in our life.\nHowever, I have found different scenarios happening in real-life, thanks to a little brother of the 30-min time box: the 15-min one! This little bro would say to you: C’mon, you have already passed 5 min, are you going lose that 5 min when you mark your proudful working session in your calendar? Since our calendar app encourages 15-min interval, lets spend 10 mins more to snap the box to the later grid.\nThats how I feel energized to, well, lets start a new question and think about it just for 10 mins. And more often than not, by the time you noticed…\nI hope by now you understand how I’m able to put myself in long session of work.\nIn the past, I have been experimenting with multiple time-management techniques, be it pomodoro, setting time goals for every week, etc. They have worked to some extents, but back then there were still some missing pieces that make them not stick. Later I have found out that it was due to the motive.\nIf you design your time management for the sake of spending time and then feel rewarded by hitting the checkboxes, it makes using the the time being the objective itself. Don’t get me wrong, if you have been setting goal for yourselves like “this week I’m spending 10 hours on this topic” and you have done that then it’s awesome. Not many people can do that consistently for a long time. I have tried and failed after a few months. However, if you find yourself having trouble keeping that habit up and even feel guilty when you couldn’t meet that goal, then maybe it’s time to really think about it.\nThere are two problems with this approach. Firstly it can feel really painful to get started, knowing that a long work session is waiting ahead today. And you can not defer because the other days are fully scheduled with likewise sessions as well. Secondly, you might not really enjoy those sessions since it feels more like obligation rather than you’re doing it with your own will. Even though feeling forced to do something is not necessary a bad thing since it’s part of every meaningful work, our mentality can be worn out over time if there is no carrot on the other side to balance the trade-off.\nSo, what should be the right motive? The simple answer is to solve problems, or finding answers to a question. This means that instead of planning 10 hours a week to study machine learning, you tell yourselves that this week I’m gonna work on this particular idea or question, like “how to systematically improve the model offline evaluation metrics?”. And one big part of the whole idea is to really think about the questions you choose to work on. Choosing problems that you really care about ignites your curiousity. Sometimes the question or idea you have last night would be the reason why you want to jump out your bed to start working on it. More often than not, each of the answer you come up for a given question is an immediate reward in itself, making each working session well-worth. Not to mention that those small and small amazing moments add up as you reach milestones, and there’s always a big sense of accomplishment whenever you stop to look back. It’s not something like: “Phew I have been able to spend 10 hours this week on studying.. nice.. it’s challenging but let’s try to keep up next week” but “oh my god how the hell have I been able to spend 22.5 hours last week to work on these topics. And by the way how may I convert the new knowledge into something more concrete, like a write-up, that I can add to my own blog so that maybe it helps others?”\nAnother beautiful side effect of this approach is that it forces you to go your own path. There is no other person on the planet that understands you better than you do, and if you spend serious time thinking about what questions matter to you most at the moment, I’m pretty sure that there are no better choices. I strongly believe this is how every great thing has been created. They are created by the very own questions in the mind of their creators. And I don’t think there is a chance that discipline per se is enough to help those people overcome walls and walls of problems along the course of finding answers to them. What’s much more likely is that they persevere though them because it’s deeply personal. Thinking about working like it’s something that pays off in the future does not really arm you with any momentum to get the ball rolling. But contemplating on what can be the answer to the questions of your own does, because now you have all sorts of monkeys and primal inner forces pushing the wheels together.\nBut I’m not telling you all of this because I know for sure that’s every successful person do it this way. In fact I’m not even a successful person myself. Nonetheless, the thing I do believe with certain is that this is how every person does if their goal is to live their own lives the way they want it to be. I bet spending most of our lifetime working on the problems each one cares about is the goal of every person in the world. Who does not?"

    "text": "Approaches\n\nAbout writing codes\nInstead of writing a long script to do everything, we break a pipeline into tasks and checkpoint interim data to disk. For example, after doing preprocess on train and test data, we dump both the data outputs and the transformer to Google Cloud Storage. We then load those objects as inputs for the next step.\nThis strategy has several purposes. First, for a long-running task, if a job fails at one of the last steps, we can re-run the pipeline from the nearest checkpoint rather than wasting time and resources restarting the whole pipeline. Second, it allows us to (1) debug more easily, (2) get alert when things break and (3) monitor interim outputs. Lastly, decoupled components can be understood more clearly, and easier to be replaced or extended later.\n\n\nAbout computing resources\nNormally for a small input size, we are fine with setting up a single virtual machine on the cloud. However, in some companies with mature cloud practice, the overhead of managing that VM is a type of cost that is difficult to justify. Especially when we have better options. For instance, Cloud Dataproc provides us with virtual machines that only live for the duration of one run, thereby free us from managing the machines. In this post, we explore Dataproc as our main engine for all the computing process."

    "text": "Step-by-step instructions\n\nCreate a GCP project and enable necessary components\n\n👉 Create a free GCP account with $300 credit by going to console.cloud.google.com. Beware that by following this tutorial, you might incur a cost of about $0.2–$0.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n👉 Click Billing at the left sidebar and initiate a billing account to be able to use the components used in this tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n👉 Select Library, then search and enable the following API: Cloud Dataproc, Cloud Storage and Cloud Firestore.\n👉 Navigate to the Firestore either by scrolling the sidebar to the left or search from the top menu bar. When you arrive at the below screen, choose SELECT NATIVE MODE, then choose us-east1 as the location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment setup\n\nStep 1: Launch terminal window\n\n👉 At the home page of your GCP project, select the command button to the right of your menubar. The CloudShell window then appears as you can see below:\n\n\n\n\n\n👉 Launch Cloud Shell Editor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s recommended to use Cloud Shell to follow this tutorial. However, if you’re using Linux and want to use terminal on your local machine, make sure you first install the Google Cloud SDK and firebase CLI.\n\n\nStep 2: Clone Github repo\n\n👉 In the Terminal window:\n\ngit clonehttps://github.com/dvquy13/gcp_ml_pipeline.git\ncd gcp_ml_pipeline\n\n👉 Select File then open the file gcp_ml_pipeline/configs/.project_env:\n\n\n\n\n\n👉 Replace the values enclosed by &lt;&gt;. For the GCP_PROJECT, you need to provide the id of your GCP project. For the remaining, feel free to choose some random names for the global variables that identify your resources. The final output looks like this:\n\nGCP_PROJECT='zinc-primer-230105'\nGCS_BUCKET=dvquys-tut-gcp-ml-pipeline\nDATA_LOCATION=us-east1\nBQ_DATASET=tut_iris\nBQ_ORG_TABLE=F_ORIGINAL\nCLUSTER_NAME=iris-pred\n\n👉 Grant execute permission to the folder scripts by running the command: chmod +x -R ./scripts. Then, run ./scripts/00_import_data_to_bigquery.sh. Link to the script.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create Dataproc cluster and submit jobs\nWe use Makefile to orchestrate our actions. You can find it here.\n️Now, run the following commands in sequence:\n\nmake create-dataproc-cluster: This command creates a Dataproc cluster. The single-node flag indicates that this is a cluster containing only one machine. n1-standard-1 is the cheapest machine we can rent. To install Python packages, we supply the metadata and initialization-actions params.\nmake build: Package your code, including your source code and other 3rd party libraries that you can not pre-install when creating the cluster (PyYAML for example). To submit a job to the cluster, we will send these codes to those machines via the gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark command.\nmake submit-job ENV=dev MODULE=data_import TASK=query_train_pred: Submit job cloning input data for training and predicting. The submit-job make command allows you to use this interface to run on both local and development environments.\nmake submit-job ENV=dev MODULE=feature_engineer TASK=normalize: Prepare features. In this illustrative example, we choose to include only normalization in the pipeline. After learning the normalization parameters from the train data set, we save those configurations for later usage.\nmake submit-job ENV=dev MODULE=model TASK=fit: Train model. Here we build a pipeline consisting of 2 steps, Normalization and Logistic Regression. After that, we persist the fit pipeline.\nmake submit-job ENV=dev MODULE=predict TASK=batch_predict: Batch predict. This job demonstrates the process when you use your learned model to make predictions.\nmake submit-job ENV=dev MODULE=predict TASK=store_predictions: Store predictions. The reason we do not combine this with the above step is two-fold. First, writing to a database often takes time and requires several retries. Second, we write to a document database like Cloud Firestore because when other team uses, they typically retrieve one document per query. However, there are times when we want to inspect the whole batch of predictions (e.g. debugging, count number of documents scored more than 0.9). For this query pattern, we will better off using the persisted outputs from the previous step, stored as parquet files in Cloud Storage.\nmake delete-dataproc-cluster: Delete Dataproc cluster. After the process finishes, delete the cluster so no further cost incurs.\n\n\n\n\nSucceeded Dataproc jobs\nYou can see that your predictions are stored at Cloud Firestore by accessing its web console.\n\n\n\nFirestore populated with predictions\nAlong the way, you will see that the output data of each step is persisted in Cloud Storage. I use parquet rather than CSV as the serialization format because it can embed schema information (therefore you do not have to specify column types when reading) and reduce storage size. For more detail, please refer to this benchmark.\n\n\n\nClean up\n\n👉 Finally, when you’re done exploring the results, you can delete all resources by running these commands:\n\n./scripts/01_erase_resources.sh\n./scripts/02_disable_resources.sh\n./scripts/03_delete_project.sh"

In practice, I also favor using script rather than user interfaces such as web console because it is self-documented and easy for others to follow the exact steps.\nconfigs/: Store all the arguments that need to be set initially. .project_env is a file to store the global variables used to work with GCP.

Both of these files serve as a centralized config store so that we can easily look up and make changes, instead of finding the configs scattered elsewhere in the code.\nMakefile: Originally Makefile is used to orchestrate the build process in C programming language. But it has done so well out of being just a shortcut so people start using it to facilitate ML model development. I have seen many tutorials using this tool, including the one that inspires me to design my Pyspark codebase.In this small project, we also use Makefile to save us a lot of time.

    "text": "Further discussion\nTo completely build and operate a pipeline, there is still more to be considered.\n\nApache Spark for bigger data\nIn this tutorial, we rent one small machine from Dataproc and use pandas as our preprocessing engine, which perfectly handles the case of data fit into the memory of that machine. However, often data input in real-world situations will be much bigger, therefore require us to use a distributed computing framework for scalability. In that case, you can just switch to using Apache Spark. From version 1.3, Spark introduces its DataFrame API, which greatly bears resemblance to Pandas counterpart. After porting your code from Pandas to Spark, to be able to run jobs across multiple machines, you just need to create a bigger cluster with a master and multiple workers.\n\n\nApache Airflow for orchestration\nMost of the batch job is not ad hoc. If it is, we should not even think about putting effort to standardize the process in the first place. Apache Airflow can play the role of both a scheduler and a monitor. It keeps metadata of each run and can send you alerts when things fail.\n\n\n\n\nExample of Airflow DAG: Source\n\n\n\nAn alternative is Dataproc Workflows. This is a native solution offered by GCP, but I haven’t tried it myself so I will just leave the documentation here.\n\n\nLocal development\nBecause rarely our codes work the first time we write them, it’s very important to be able to quickly test without having to go through all the boilerplate steps from setting up variables to requesting cloud resources. My suggestion is that we should set up our local environment asap. We can install Apache Spark 2.4.3+ to act as our runner engine, and MongoDB to be our alternative for Cloud Firestore. Here in the code repo, you can still refer to some line containing what I call the “environment branching logic”, which enables you to switch between running the same code on both local and cloud environments.\n\n\nUnit testing\nMany people have already talked about unit testing, so I won’t go too detailed here. I also don’t do unit testing in this tutorial for the sake of simplicity. However, I strongly encourage you to add testing yourself. Whatever it takes, unit testing forces us to modularize our code and add a layer of alerting. This is very important because things in data science often break in silence."

We’ve also populated these systems with our trained model artifacts, item embeddings, and user sequence data. We have come near the end of the journey! What’s left is to build the actual API layer that brings everything together and serves real-time recommendations to users.\nThis chapter explores how to package our trained models for serving using BentoML, and how to orchestrate the complete recommendation pipeline using FastAPI. By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a fully functional recommendation API running on your local machine that can adapt to user interests in real-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\nAll code for this chapter is available in the api/ and model_server/ directories, along with the compose.api.yml file in the project repository."

Let’s walk through the complete flow to understand how each piece works together.\n\nRequest Processing and Fallback Strategy\nOur serving architecture prioritizes personalization when possible but ensures users always receive relevant recommendations, even when personalization fails.\nInitial Request and Context Gathering\nWhen a recommendation request arrives at our FastAPI orchestrator, it contains the user’s current session context—items they’ve recently viewed or interacted with—along with an optional user identifier. The orchestrator’s first priority is to enrich this context with historical user data.\nUser Feature Retrieval \nThe system immediately attempts to fetch the user’s historical interaction data from Redis. When user context is successfully retrieved and contains meaningful interaction data, the system proceeds with the full personalization pipeline:\n\nQuery Embedding Generation: The enriched user context (historical + current session) is sent to our BentoML model server, which generates the dense representation of the user’s preferences and current intent.\nVector Similarity Search: This query embedding is used to search Qdrant’s vector database, finding items most similar to the user’s demonstrated preferences.\nFiltering and Ranking: Results are filtered to remove items the user has already interacted with and ranked by relevance score.\n\nBut wait. What is BentoML model server? What is the difference between BentoML and FastAPI?"

    "section": "Model Server vs Orchestrator",
    "text": "Model Server vs Orchestrator\nAs mentioned above, serving recommendations typically requires two kinds of logic: model inference and business rules. While business rules are operations often found in a backend system, model inference is a specialized task that has a different set of characteristics:\n\nIndependent Scaling: Model servers sometimes require GPU resources for inference and benefit from batch processing to maximize throughput. The orchestrator, conversely, handles lightweight business logic and can run efficiently on CPU-only instances.\nVersion Management: We should expect ourselves to experiment with new models frequently. Having a dedicated model server means we can deploy new model versions, conduct A/B tests, or rollback problematic releases without touching the orchestrator logic. This reduces the blast radius of model-related issues.\nTechnology Flexibility: The model server can use specialized ML serving frameworks (like BentoML, TorchServe, TensorFlow Serving, or Triton) optimized for inference performance, while the orchestrator can use general-purpose web frameworks (like FastAPI, Flask, or Django) optimized for API development productivity.\n\nA clear separation ensures that each component can be optimized for its specific responsibilities while maintaining clean interfaces between them.\nFor our implementation, we chose FastAPI for the orchestrator due to its popularity and developer-friendly async capabilities, while BentoML serves as our model server with its robust MLflow integration and specialized ML serving features.\nWhile there’s not much to discuss about FastAPI, there are some specific elaborations needed on the side of BentoML regarding how I use it in this project."

    "text": "BentoML x MLflow\nOne of BentoML’s strengths is its seamless integration with MLflow. Remember how we logged our sequence model to MLflow in previous chapters? BentoML can directly import these models along with all their dependencies and custom inference logic.\n\n\nmodel_server/service.py\n\nmodel_cfg = {\n    model_name: {\n        \"name\": model_name,\n        \"deploy_alias\": \"champion\",\n        \"model_uri\": f\"models:/{model_name}@champion\",\n    },\n}\n\nfor name, cfg in model_cfg.items():\n    bentoml.mlflow.import_model(\n        name,\n        model_uri=cfg[\"model_uri\"],\n        signatures={\n            \"predict\": {\"batchable\": True},\n        },\n    )\n\nThis code demonstrates how BentoML imports our trained model directly from MLflow using the champion alias. The batchable: True flag enables automatic batching for improved throughput—multiple concurrent requests will be batched together for more efficient GPU utilization.\nLater when you start the API services via Docker, you can observe that BentoML downloads the model from MLflow:\n\n\n\n\nCustom Inference Logic Integration\nIn the previous chapters we didn’t talk about the src/sequence/inference.py file that exists in the src/sequence module, but if you pay attention in the training notebook, here’s what you would find:\n\n\nnotebooks/011-sequence-modeling.ipynb\n\ninferrer = SequenceRetrieverInferenceWrapper(best_model)\ninferrer.load_context(ctx)\n\nif cfg.run.log_to_mlflow:\n    run_id = trainer.logger.run_id\n    sample_output_np = sample_output\n    signature = infer_signature(sample_input, sample_output_np)\n    idm_filename = idm_fp.split(\"/\")[-1]\n    mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\n        python_model=inferrer,\n        artifact_path=\"inferrer\",\n        # We log the id_mapping to the predict function so that it can accept item_id and automatically convert ot item_indice for PyTorch model to use\n        artifacts={\"idm\": mlflow.get_artifact_uri(idm_filename)},\n        signature=signature,\n        input_example=sample_input,\n        registered_model_name=cfg.train.retriever.mlf_model_name,\n    )\n\nThis SequenceRetrieverInferenceWrapper class wraps our model with inference logic that handles ID mapping, sequence padding, and tensor conversion to help BentoML to load and use the model correctly.\n\n\nsrc/sequence/inference.py\n\nclass SequenceRetrieverInferenceWrapper(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\n    def load_context(self, context):\n        \"\"\"\n        This load_context method is automatically called when later we load the model.\n        \"\"\"\n        json_path = context.artifacts[\"idm\"]\n        self.idm = IDMapper().load(json_path)\n\n    def predict(self, context, model_input, params=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Args:\n            model_input: Expected to contain keys 'user_ids', 'candidate_items', and 'item_seq'.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not isinstance(model_input, dict):\n            model_input = model_input.to_dict(orient=\"records\")[0]\n        infer_output = self.infer(model_input).tolist()\n        return {**model_input, \"scores\": infer_output}\n\n\n\nBentoML Service Implementation\nFor our retrieval serving use case, instead of just calling the model.predict() method like for a normal ML model, we need to access the model’s query embedding generation function. Our BentoML service provides multiple endpoints for different inference needs:\n\n\nmodel_server/service.py\n\n@bentoml.service(name=\"seq_retriever_service\")\nclass SeqRetrieverService:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.model = bentoml.mlflow.load_model(self.bento_model)\n        self.inferer = self.model.unwrap_python_model()\n\n    @bentoml.api\n    def predict(self, ctx: RetrieveContext):\n        resp = self.model.predict(ctx.model_dump())\n        return self._augment_response(resp, ctx)\n\n    @bentoml.api\n    def get_query_embeddings(self, ctx: RetrieveContext):\n        item_seq = [\n            self.inferer.idm.get_item_index(item_id) for item_id in ctx.item_seq_raw[0]\n        ]\n        inputs = {\"item_seq\": torch.tensor([item_seq])}\n        query_embedding = self.inferer.model.get_query_embeddings(inputs)\n        resp = {\"query_embedding\": query_embedding.detach().numpy().tolist()}\n        return self._augment_response(resp, ctx)"

One of the key organizational decisions in our orchestrator is the introduction of a service layer that encapsulates all business logic. This pattern, borrowed from domain-driven design, provides several benefits.\nFastAPI endpoints are reserved to focus on HTTP-specific concerns like request parsing, response formatting, and error handling, while the service layer focuses on domain logic such as fetching user context, calling external services, and filtering results. This separation makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to reason about.\nFrom a testing perspective, business logic can be unit tested independently of the FastAPI framework, making tests faster and more focused. You can test complex recommendation logic without spinning up a web server or dealing with HTTP request/response cycles. Additionally, the same service logic could be reused by different interfaces—whether REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, or background jobs—without code duplication.\nThe service layer also improves dependency management by clearly declaring its dependencies, such as Redis clients, Qdrant clients, and ID mappers. This explicit dependency declaration makes the system’s architecture more transparent and easier to understand, while also facilitating dependency injection for testing and different deployment environments.\n\n\nRequest Processing Pipeline\nLet’s trace through a complete recommendation request to understand how all components work together.\nFirst, we have a RetrieveContext class that defines the schema for the information needed to make the retrieval request.\n\n\nsrc/dto.py\n\nclass RetrieveContext(BaseModel):\n    user_ids_raw: Optional[List[str]] = []\n    item_seq_raw: Optional[List[List[str]]] = [[]]\n    candidate_items_raw: Optional[List[str]] = []\n\nThis is the input to the retrieve_recommendations method.\n\n\napi/services.py\n\nclass RecommendationService:\n    # ...\n\n    async def retrieve_recommendations(\n        self, ctx: RetrieveContext, count: int\n    ) -&gt; RecommendationResponse:\n        # Items to exclude from recommendations\n        items_to_exclude = set()\n\n        if len(ctx.user_ids_raw) &gt; 0 and (user_id := ctx.user_ids_raw[0]):\n            logger.info(f\"Getting recent interactions for user: {user_id}\")\n            user_id = ctx.user_ids_raw[0]\n            user_prev_interactions = self.get_user_prev_interactions(user_id)[\n                \"recent_interactions\"\n1            ]\n\n            # Add user's previous interactions to exclusion set\n            items_to_exclude.update(user_prev_interactions)\n\n            curr_item_seq = ctx.item_seq_raw[0]\n            ctx.item_seq_raw = [user_prev_interactions + curr_item_seq]\n\n        # Add items from input sequence to exclusion set\n        if ctx.item_seq_raw and ctx.item_seq_raw[0]:\n            items_to_exclude.update(ctx.item_seq_raw[0])\n\n        logger.info(\n            f\"[DEBUG] Items to exclude from recommendations: {items_to_exclude}\"\n        )\n\n        if len(ctx.item_seq_raw[0]) == 0:\n            logger.info(\"Empty RetrieveContext, fallback to popular recommendations\")\n2            return await self.get_popular_recommendations(count)\n\n    query_embedding_resp = await self.call_seq_retriever(\n        ctx, \"get_query_embeddings\"\n    )\n    query_embedding = np.array(query_embedding_resp.result[\"query_embedding\"])\n\n    # Get more recommendations than needed since we'll filter some out\n    buffer_count = count + len(items_to_exclude)\n    hits = self.services.ann_index.search(\n        collection_name=cfg.vectorstore.qdrant.collection_name,\n        query_vector=query_embedding[0],\n        limit=buffer_count,\n    )\n\n    # Filter out items that should be excluded\n    filtered_recommendations = []\n    for hit in hits:\n        item_id = hit.payload.get(\"parent_asin\", \"\")\n        if item_id not in items_to_exclude:\n            filtered_recommendations.append(\n                {\"score\": hit.model_dump()[\"score\"], **hit.payload}\n            )\n            if len(filtered_recommendations) &gt;= count:\n                break\n\n    return RecommendationResponse(\n        recommendations=filtered_recommendations,\n        ctx=ctx.model_dump(),\n    )\n\n\n1\n\nGet the user’s previous interactions from Redis.\n\n2\n\nFallback to popular recommendations.\n\n\nThis above implementation demonstrates several important patterns that make our recommendation system robust and effective. The most fundamental pattern is context enrichment, where the system fetches user’s historical interactions from Redis and merges them with the current session data. This creates a comprehensive view of user behavior that spans both past preferences and immediate intent.\nThe system also implements graceful degradation by falling back to popular recommendations when no meaningful sequence data is available. This ensures that new users or those with insufficient interaction history still receive valuable recommendations rather than empty results.\nTo improve user experience, the pipeline implements a business rule-based filtering that excludes items the user has already interacted with, preventing redundant recommendations. Finally, the buffer strategy retrieves more results than actually needed to account for this filtering process, ensuring we can always return the requested number of fresh recommendations even after removing items the user has already seen.\n\n\nAsynchronous Processing\nYou’ll notice extensive use of async and await throughout our orchestrator code. This isn’t just a modern Python practice—it’s essential for building responsive APIs that handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.\nOur recommendation pipeline involves multiple I/O operations including Redis lookups, HTTP calls to the model server, and Qdrant queries. Traditional synchronous code would block the entire process during each operation, severely limiting concurrency and creating bottlenecks that degrade user experience. With async/await, Python can handle hundreds of concurrent requests with a single thread, switching between requests during I/O waits. This dramatically reduces memory usage compared to thread-per-request models while ensuring that users don’t have to wait for other users’ requests to complete—each request is processed as quickly as possible without blocking others.\n# Multiple concurrent operations that can be performed in parallel\nasync with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n    response = await client.post(\n        f\"{self.seq_retriever_model_server_url}/{endpoint}\",\n        json=payload,\n        headers={\n            \"accept\": \"application/json\",\n            \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n        },\n    )\n\n\nRequest Tracing: Debugging in Production\nProduction ML systems can be complex to debug when things go wrong. Our API implements comprehensive request tracing to help identify issues quickly:\n\n\napi/logging_utils.py\n\nclass RequestIDMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):\n    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):\n        rec_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n        request.state.rec_id = rec_id\n\n        # Contextualize logger with the request ID\n        with logger.contextualize(rec_id=rec_id):\n            response = await call_next(request)\n\n        # Add rec_id to the output response\n        if response.headers.get(\"Content-Type\", \"\") == \"application/json\":\n            # ... add rec_id to response metadata\n\nUnique Request IDs: Every API request gets a unique identifier that’s included in all log messages and response metadata. This makes it possible to trace a single request’s journey through all system components.\nStructured Logging: Debug information is logged in structured formats that can be easily parsed and analyzed:\nlogger.debug(\n    f\"[COLLECT] Payload prepared: &lt;features&gt;{json.dumps(payload)}&lt;/features&gt;\"\n)\nResponse Enrichment: The middleware automatically adds request metadata to responses, providing clients with debugging information without cluttering the main API logic.\nThis tracing infrastructure becomes invaluable when debugging issues like:\n\nWhy did a specific user receive unexpected recommendations?\nWhich requests are taking longer than expected?\nAre there patterns in failing requests?\n\n\n\nReal-Time Context Integration\nAs we discussed in Chapter 1, our recommendation system uses a simplified request-payload approach for real-time context integration rather than complex streaming architectures. This design choice allows us to focus on the ML aspects while maintaining the benefits of real-time personalization. Let’s see how this works in practice within our serving architecture.\n\n\n\n\nExample API Payload showing real-time context\n\n\n\nThe API payload demonstrates the core implementation of this approach—recent user interactions are included directly in each recommendation request through the item_seq_raw field, which contains items the user has interacted with in their current session. Our orchestrator then merges this real-time session data with historical user data retrieved from Redis, creating a comprehensive view of user intent that spans both immediate behavior and long-term preferences.\nThis implementation delivers the advantages we outlined in Chapter 1, starting with minimal signal delay since user interactions are captured client-side and sent immediately with recommendation requests, eliminating the latency of updating server-side state. The stateless nature of each request makes the system easier to scale and debug, as all necessary context is self-contained within the request payload. Additionally, users can continue browsing and building session context even when temporarily disconnected, as the frontend maintains the interaction history locally until the next API call. Finally, users do not really need to refresh the view to get updated recommendations."

    "text": "Serving Paradigms: From Model to User Experience\nI have been always thinking that building a recommendation model is like crafting a perfect recipe for a gourmet dish. You might have the most sophisticated ingredients, precise measurements, and innovative techniques, but until that dish reaches hungry customers, it’s just potential sitting in the kitchen. The recipe itself doesn’t feed anyone—it’s the execution, plating, and delivery that creates value. Similarly, our sequence-based recommendation model, no matter how accurate its predictions, remains useless until it can respond to real user requests in real-time.\nThis analogy extends further when we consider the restaurant’s serving strategy. A restaurant doesn’t prepare each dish from scratch when a customer orders. Instead, they use a combination of pre-preparation (mise en place) and real-time cooking. Some components are prepped in batches during quiet hours, while others must be prepared fresh to order. Recommendation systems follow the same principle: we balance pre-computed results with real-time inference based on the specific requirements of each use case.\n\nHow Recommendations Reach Users\n\n\n\n\nAn overview of the serving pipeline\n\n\n\nUnderstanding serving paradigms starts with tracing the journey from user action to displayed recommendations. When a user opens your app, a carefully orchestrated process begins:\n\nFrontend Request: The mobile app or web interface detects the user’s need for recommendations (homepage load, category browse, search query)\nAPI Call: The frontend makes a REST API call to the backend, passing user context (user ID, current page, device info)\nBackend Processing: The recommendation service processes this request, either by looking up pre-computed results or fetching the other features necessary for the model to make inference\nResponse Assembly: Results are ranked, filtered for business rules, and formatted for display\nFrontend Rendering: The app receives the recommendations and renders them in the user interface\n\nWhile the actual requirements vary between use cases, normally this entire pipeline must complete within 200ms at the 95th percentile to maintain user engagement. Any longer, and users start experiencing the dreaded loading spinner that kills conversion rates.\n\n\nTwo Paradigms: Batch Pre-computation vs Online Serving\nThe critical decision in this pipeline happens at step 3: how does the backend generate recommendations? There are two fundamental paradigms, each with distinct trade-offs:\nBatch Pre-computation follows the “prepare ahead” strategy. Recommendations are generated offline for all users during low-traffic periods and stored in a key-value store like Redis or DynamoDB. When a user makes a request, the API simply looks up their pre-computed recommendations—a blazingly fast operation that typically completes in under 10ms.\n# Batch pre-computation approach\ndef batch_generate_recommendations():\n    \"\"\"Run offline to pre-compute recommendations for all users.\"\"\"\n    for user_id in all_users:\n        recommendations = model.predict(user_id)\n        redis_client.set(f\"recs:{user_id}\", recommendations, ex=3600)\n\ndef serve_recommendations(user_id):\n    \"\"\"Fast lookup during serving.\"\"\"\n    return redis_client.get(f\"recs:{user_id}\")\nOnline Serving follows the “cook to order” strategy. The model inference happens in real-time when users make requests. This requires the recommendation model to be deployed as a service that can respond to API calls within milliseconds.\n# Online serving approach\ndef serve_recommendations(user_id, context):\n    \"\"\"Real-time model inference during serving.\"\"\"\n    user_features = get_user_features(user_id)\n    contextual_features = extract_context(context)\n    return model.predict(user_features, contextual_features)\n\n\nWhen to Choose Each Paradigm\nThe choice between batch pre-computation and online serving isn’t arbitrary—it depends on your specific constraints and requirements. Batch pre-computation shines when recommendations don’t need real-time context. It’s also ideal when you can tolerate slightly stale recommendations that are updated periodically, perhaps hourly or daily, in exchange for guaranteed fast response times under all conditions. And it’s particularly attractive when your infrastructure needs to be simple and cost-effective, especially if you’re serving millions of users and want predictable resource utilization patterns.\nOn the other hand, online serving becomes essential when having access to real-time contexts for recommendations is crucial in ensuring the relevance of our recommendations. Those contexts can be a user’s current shopping cart contents, her search query, or time-sensitive factors like current location or weather. All of these signals share an important property: we don’t know them in advance, so pre-computation is not an option.\nIn practice, most production recommendation systems use a hybrid approach that combines both paradigms strategically. The default fallback homepage might display pre-computed “trending items” in cases of new users or errors from the recommendation services. In the remaining happy cases, we pass the relevant contexts to the model endpoints to provide better browsing experiences for users. This hybrid strategy optimizes for both performance and personalization.\nAs you can see, the UI demo for our project also starts by showing the popular recommendations before updating the list with respect to user’s interactions."

    "text": "Three-Pillar Serving Architecture\nHow to implement this hybrid serving strategy?\nWe’ll set up three main components that form the backbone of serving our retrieval model: MLflow for model registry and deployment, Qdrant for vector similarity search, and Redis as KV store for user sequences and metadata.\n\n\n\n\nThree-pillar serving architecture with Model Registry, Vector Store, and Key-Value Store\n\n\n\n\nPillar 1: Model Registry (MLflow)\nThe Model Registry serves as the single source of truth for all model artifacts and metadata. Instead of need to look up which S3 path pointing to which model version, we have a nice abstraction layer to manage and use our trained models much more easily.\nMLflow Model Registry provides several useful capabilities for model serving:\n\nModel Versioning: Every model training run produces a versioned artifact with associated metadata (metrics, parameters, training data lineage)\nStage Management: Models progress through stages like “Staging” → “Champion” → “Archived” with clear governance\nA/B Testing Support: Multiple model versions can be deployed simultaneously with traffic splitting\n\n\n\nPillar 2: Vector Store (Qdrant)\nThe goal of Vector Store is to make similarity search efficient. While traditional databases excel at exact matches for structured data, the nature of our embeddings demands a different indexing approach. With the rising popularity of LLMs and their ability to generate embeddings, a handful of vector databases have emerged to provide solutions.\nIn our case, our sequence model’s candidate tower generates embeddings for all items in the catalog. These embeddings are indexed in Qdrant, enabling fast retrieval of the most relevant candidates based on a user’s current sequence.\nThe choice of using Qdrant here is nothing too special rather than personal, as I happen to find myself comfortable with it.\n\n\nPillar 3: Key-Value Store (Redis)\nThe Key-Value Store serves as the system’s memory for frequently accessed data and computational shortcuts. In recommendation systems, this typically includes user sequences, popular items, and pre-computed features that would be expensive to generate on-the-fly.\nFor our recommender system, here Redis plays the role of a feature store where our back-end can retrieve each user’s recent interaction history. On the other hand, it also contains the popular items as a form of pre-computed recommendations.\nWhen thinking about which open source tool to use for the key-value store, I must admit that Redis is so widely used that I don’t really consider other options, especially for a tutorial project like this.\nAfter understanding those three pillars, let’s take a closer look at how we configure them running on our local environment."

    "text": "Docker Compose Configuration\n\n\n\nDocker logo\n\n\nDocker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Think of it as creating a standardized shipping container1 for your software. Just as shipping containers can move seamlessly between trucks, ships, and trains regardless of their contents, Docker containers can run consistently across different environments, from your laptop to production servers. This is particularly valuable for ML systems where dependency management can become complex, with different services requiring specific versions of Python, database drivers, or system libraries. It’s becoming a standard approach to package application services for a lot of teams nowadays.\nDocker Compose takes this concept one step further by orchestrating multiple containers as a unified application stack. Instead of manually starting each service and configuring their networking, Docker Compose allows us to define our entire infrastructure—MLflow, Qdrant, Redis, and their supporting databases—in a single configuration file. With a simple docker-compose up command, we can spin up our complete serving environment with all services properly connected and configured. This approach eliminates the “works on my machine” problem that often plagues ML deployments, ensuring that anyone can reproduce the exact same serving environment that we’ve designed.\nHere’s what our Docker Compose file looks like:\n\n\ncompose.yml\n\nservices:\n  qdrant:\n    image: qdrant/qdrant:v1.12.0\n    ports:\n      - \"6333:6333\"\n      - \"6334:6334\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./data/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z\n    restart: always\n\n  kv_store:\n    image: redis:7.2-bookworm\n    container_name: kv_store\n    ports:\n      - \"${REDIS_PORT}:6379\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./data/redis:/data\n    env_file:\n      - .env\n    healthcheck:\n      test: [\"CMD\", \"redis-cli\", \"-p\", \"6379\", \"ping\"]\n      interval: 10s\n      timeout: 30s\n      retries: 50\n      start_period: 30s\n\n  mlflow_server:\n    restart: always\n    build: ./mlflow\n    image: mlflow_server\n    container_name: mlflow_server\n    depends_on:\n      - mlflow_mc\n      - mlflow_db\n    ports:\n      - \"5002:5000\"\n    environment:\n      - MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://minio:9000\n      - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}\n      - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}\n    command: &gt;\n      mlflow server\n        --backend-store-uri mysql+pymysql://${MYSQL_USER}:${MYSQL_PASSWORD}@mlflow_db:3306/${MYSQL_DATABASE}\n        --artifacts-destination s3://mlflow\n        --serve-artifacts\n        --host 0.0.0.0\n        --port 5000\n\nThis configuration defines our entire serving infrastructure as code. A simple docker compose up -d command brings up all services with proper networking, volumes, and health checks configured.\nAlthough it’s pretty straightforward when you look how Redis and Qdrant are defined, I need to elaborate a bit on the MLflow part.\n\nSetting up MLflow Model Registry\nMLflow Model Registry serves as our model deployment pipeline, providing versioning, staging, and rollback capabilities essential for production ML systems. By design MLflow coordinates between two backend systems: a MySQL Database that stores all the metadata—experiments, runs, parameters, metrics, and model registry information—and MinIO S3 Storage that acts as the artifact store where the actual model binaries, datasets, and logs are persisted. MLflow Server acts as the central orchestration service, providing REST APIs for experiment tracking, model registration, and serving.\nThis separation of metadata and artifacts provides both performance and scalability benefits. The database can quickly serve metadata queries for experiment comparisons and model lookups, while the object storage efficiently handles large model files without putting pressure on the database.\nNow it should be clear why we need to run make ml-platform-up before running our notebooks in previous chapters. We do not need to worry too much about where the train models are stored, cause they sit happily in MLflow Registry. Below is the example code snippet for loading models:\n\n\nnotebooks/020-ann-index.ipynb\n\nmlf_client = mlflow.MlflowClient()\nmlf_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(\n    model_uri=f\"models:/{cfg.train.retriever.mlf_model_name}@champion\"\n)\nrun_id = mlf_model.metadata.run_id\nrun_info = mlf_client.get_run(run_id).info\nartifact_uri = run_info.artifact_uri\n\ninferer = mlf_model.unwrap_python_model()\nid_mapping = inferer.idm\n\nNext we will populate Qdrant and Redis with the data they need to support online serving."

    "section": "The Challenges of Evaluation in Recommendation Systems",
    "text": "The Challenges of Evaluation in Recommendation Systems\nRecommendation systems are often regarded as being tricky to model and evaluate. Unlike in problems where ground truth is straightforward, in RecSys there is often a difference between what we call “labels” and the target user behavior. Eventually our goal is to find relevant items that user likes at any given time. But not always in our historical data we can observe that “like” behavior. Noises like misclick, another person borrowing the user’s device, or robot browsing can make it harder for the model to learn and for us to understand its true performance.\nYou train a model and have it produce a new set of item suggestions for a particular user. In the ideal scenario we want to collect that user’s actual behavior when he sees this list at the current moment. The right context is important because it affects your intentions and interests. In general I’m interested in gaming videos on Youtube, but during bed time I often want to watch people telling stories about lives of the wild animals.\nThis kind of messing with time is common when doing science. There are controlled experiments, right? Why don’t just run online experiment for any idea we have?\nIMHO, it’s not feasible to do so, because they are typically expensive and slow. Methods like A/B tests in general require real users, real traffic, and real time to see if your changes work. So to iterate quickly on your backlog of a dozen of different ideas, we don’t really have any other choices rather than resorting to offline evaluation as our development tool. That assumes, of course, that getting scores on old data actually points you towards better real-world models.\nBeyond this counterfactual challenge, recommendation systems need to provide answers for (1) implicit feedback where users rarely provide explicit ratings, (2) ranking quality as user may only see a few items up top, (3) personalization where a perfect recommendation for one user might be terrible for another, and (4) temporal dynamics where user preferences evolve over time. In short, recommendations involve nuanced concepts of relevance, satisfaction, and utility that resist simple measurement.\nTo address these challenges, we need a comprehensive evaluation framework that can measure multiple aspects of recommendation quality. For the scope of this tutorial, we would be focusing on measuring both the ranking and the classification effectiveness of the recommendations, while leaving the problem of counterfactual evaluation for a future post perhaps1.\nAll in all, we’ll focus on offline evaluation because it lets us iterate fast. But the important message worths repeating—the real test happens when your recommendations meet actual users."

    "section": "Evaluation Metrics for Recommendation Systems",
    "text": "Evaluation Metrics for Recommendation Systems\nWhen deploying a new recommendation model, we often want to see how many more clicks and purchases we get. In business terms, we formally define them as Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR). As discussed above, offline evaluation does not have access to those metrics, but somehow they need to perform well on these matters online. Therefore, we use “proxy” metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our model when it’s still in development.\nThere are plenty of great posts diving into the details of these proxies so I would just briefly mention some of them here.\n\nRanking Metrics\n\nPrecision@K: What fraction of top-K recommendations are relevant?\nRecall@K: What fraction of relevant items appear in top-K recommendations?\nNDCG@K: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain—rewards relevant items appearing higher in the ranking\n\n\n\nDiversity Metrics\n\nPersonalization: Measures how different recommendations are across users (higher is better)\n\n\n\nClassification Metrics\n\nROC-AUC: Area under the ROC curve for binary relevance prediction\nPrecision-Recall curves: Trade-offs between precision and recall at different thresholds\n\nWhy classification metrics? Isn’t this a ranking problem? Well, the answer is yes and no. Essentially the choice of modeling approach is up to us, but there is one valid approach in which we would formulate the problem as predicting whether a user would interact with an item or not. As the output of this model would normally be a score between 0 and 1, we can then use the ROC-AUC to evaluate how well a model is able to rank the relevant items higher that the irrelevant ones, which is a form of ranking quality in and of itself. The other main benefit for using ROC-AUC is that it’s also a built-in metric for almost all ML frameworks, which makes it easy to measure without the need to implement it from scratch (lazy person saying).\nIf you wish to learn more, I suggest checking out this post by Amit Chaudhary and the Evidently documentation on Ranking metrics."

My hypothesis is that they are the items that have existed longer and maybe popular in the past but not now, while the top 13 and above contains recent and still trending books.\nThere is also a log_classification_metrics function that follows the similar pattern, but for the task of evaluation classification accuracy.\nThe output is we have reports like this:\n\n\n\nDo you notice that the report files can be accessed from a nice web-based UI?"

    "text": "Experiment Tracking with MLflow\nMachine learning development is fundamentally an iterative process—the more ideas we systematically test, the better our chances of discovering meaningful improvements. This iterative nature means we’re constantly cycling through hypotheses: trying new features, adjusting hyperparameters, experimenting with different architectures, and refining our approach based on results.\nTo maximize this exploration while maintaining scientific rigor, we need more than just robust evaluation metrics; we need a convenient way to track every experiment, compare results across iterations, and easily revisit previous approaches. Comprehensive experiment logging creates a safety net that encourages bold experimentation—when you know you can reproduce any previous result or quickly understand what changed between runs, you’re more willing to try ambitious ideas that might not work. This psychological safety accelerates the entire development cycle.\nThere are often no restrictions on how you should track your experiments. Even manually keeping things in a spreadsheet works just fine. Based on my own experience, I feel like MLflow is the most convenient way though, since this tool is mature and well-integrated with other ML frameworks. It also offers other fundamental capabilities like model registry which becomes very handy when we talk about model serving and deployment.\nAs MLflow should be enabled in our every model training run, I put most of the MLflow integration implementation in our configuration code:\nfrom src.cfg import ConfigLoader\n\n# Load configuration and initialize MLflow\ncfg = ConfigLoader(\"../cfg/common.yaml\")\ncfg.run.run_name = \"001-baseline-popular\"\ncfg.run.experiment_name = \"Retrieve - Binary\"\ncfg.init()\nThe cfg.init() method handles all the MLflow setup:\nfrom lightning.pytorch.loggers import MLFlowLogger\n\nclass ConfigLoader:\n    # ...\n\n    def init(self):\n        \"\"\"Initialize MLflow experiment tracking automatically.\"\"\"\n        if self.run.log_to_mlflow:\n            logger.info(f\"Setting up MLflow experiment {self.run.experiment_name}...\")\n            mlflow.set_experiment(self.run.experiment_name)\n            mlflow.start_run(run_name=self.run.run_name)\n            \n1            self._mlf_logger = MLFlowLogger(\n                experiment_name=self.run.experiment_name,\n                run_id=mlflow.active_run().info.run_id,\n                tracking_uri=mlflow_uri,\n                log_model=True,\n            )\n        return self\n\n1\n\nNote that MLFlowLogger here is a PyTorch Lightning logger, which we would use later when defining our PyTorch Lightning model for logging our model training progress.\n\n\nIn the end of our run, we can call this method cfg.log_config_to_mlflow() to log all parameters to MLflow:\ndef log_config_to_mlflow(self):\n    \"\"\"Log all configuration parameters to MLflow with dot notation.\"\"\"\n    flat_config = flatten_dict(self.config.model_dump())\n    for key, value in flat_config.items():\n        mlflow.log_param(key, value)  # e.g., \"train.learning_rate\": 0.01\nThe result is we can access our experiment parameters like this:\n\n\n\nIf for some reasons we don’t want to log your run to MLflow e.g. when we starts to develop our notebook, we can easily control this behavior by setting the log_to_mlflow flag to false in our configuration file:\n# cfg/common.yaml\nrun:\n  log_to_mlflow: true\n  experiment_name: \"Retrieve - Binary\"\nAt this point, you’ve got a working popularity-based recommender, a full offline evaluation pipeline, and MLflow tracking wired into your runs. With those pieces in place, you can safely try out new ideas, compare experiments side by side, and roll back if something goes sideways."

Here’s what we covered:\n\nThe fundamental evaluation challenges: We explored why recommendation systems are uniquely difficult to evaluate, mostly from the angle of counterfactual problem (we only see what users actually encountered).\nOnline vs offline evaluation strategy: We established the principle that while online metrics are the ultimate business goal, offline evaluation serves as our rapid iteration tool. The key assumption: offline improvements don’t always translate to online wins, but they provide essential guidance for systematic development.\nComprehensive evaluation metrics: We implemented a multi-dimensional framework using Evidently that captures ranking quality (Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG@K), diversity (Personalization), and classification performance (ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall curves). We also justified why classification metrics make sense for recommendation systems when framed as binary relevance prediction.\nPopularity-based baseline implementation: We built our first recommender system—a simple but effective popularity-based model that assigns the most frequently interacted items to all users. This baseline serves as our performance benchmark and validates that our evaluation pipeline works correctly.\nMLflow experiment tracking integration: We created a configuration-driven system that automatically handles experiment setup, parameter logging, and artifact storage. This infrastructure encourages bold experimentation by providing the safety net of full reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\nAll code for this chapter is available in the notebooks/010-baseline-popular.ipynb file and the src/eval/ directory in the project repository."

    "text": "Dataset Overview: Amazon Reviews 2023\nA good RecSys dataset typically has the following characteristics:\n\nTemporal richness: Each interaction has a timestamp, enabling sequence modeling\nScale: Millions of interactions across thousands of users and items\nReal-world patterns: Authentic user behavior with natural sparsity\n\nFor this tutorial, instead of using the well-known MovieLens dataset, I chose the Amazon Reviews 2023 collection from the McAuley Lab, specifically the “Books” category. Beyond the above characteristics, it offers other useful signals like user reviews and item descriptions.\n\n\n\nWith HuggingFace’s dataset library, we can download everything with just one line of code. The package also caches the downloaded assets by default, so subsequent runs will take almost no time.\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\ndataset = load_dataset(\n    cfg.data.hf_datasets.name,\n    \"5core_timestamp_Books\",\n    trust_remote_code=True,\n)\n\n\n\nThe main schema of the dataset is quite simple:\n# From cfg/common.yaml\ndata:\n1  user_col: \"user_id\"\n2  item_col: \"parent_asin\"\n3  rating_col: \"rating\"\n4  timestamp_col: \"timestamp\"\n\n1\n\nUnique user identifier\n\n2\n\nProduct identifier (in our case, the ASIN—Amazon Standard Identification Number)\n\n3\n\nUser rating (1-5 scale)\n\n4\n\nInteraction timestamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Management\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom src.cfg import ConfigLoader\n\n# Load configuration\ncfg = ConfigLoader(\"cfg/common.yaml\")\nThroughout this project, we store most configuration in cfg/common.yaml. This design does not only make it easier for notebooks and scripts to access their inputs and outputs but also help us try different configurations easily.\n\n\n\nAs you can see above, the train dataset has almost 9M ratings for us to play with. That’s not small at all. However, if you think we’re going to use big data processing for those interactions, this isn’t the case for our series. The first thing I normally do with raw data is to not utilize all the data points.\nIn fact, I even go the opposite direction."

    "section": "Data Sampling and Filtering",
    "text": "Data Sampling and Filtering\nLet’s discuss why we may consider sampling data as the first thing to do for our project.\nIf you study the documentation of our Amazon Reviews dataset, you will find that they provide two variants:\n\nPure IDs (0-Core)\n\nPros of 0-Core: Comprehensive data, Maximum diversity, Rich context, Potential form, Generalization.\nCons of 0-Core: Data noise, Large size and high resource demands, Quality variability, Imbalanced distribution.\n\nPure IDs (5-Core)\n\nPros of 5-Core: Higher quality reviews, Reduced noise, Balanced distribution and Computational efficiency.\nCons of 5-Core: Limited diversity, Misalignment with original data distribution, Loss of context, Generalizability and Limited data size for scaling up.\n\n— Amazon Reviews 2023 Dataset Documentation\n\nPay attention to the pros they give for the 5-Core version: “Higher quality reviews, Reduced noise, Balanced distribution and Computational efficiency”. I find myself specifically resonating with the last aspect.\nAs ML is mostly about iterative development, it’s by design that the faster we can run operations on our data, the more progress we can make. Being able to quickly experiment different ideas offline offer you a lot of advantages.\nFor instance, you can rapidly test different feature engineering approaches—whether adding user demographics, item metadata, or temporal features actually improves model performance. You can efficiently compare multiple model architectures (neural collaborative filtering vs. sequential models vs. matrix factorization) within the hours rather than days. Additionally, quick iteration also enables you to discover data quality issues early, such as identifying that certain user segments have vastly different interaction patterns which may suggest a need for new input signals. Finally, fast experimentation saves you a lot of time searching for optimal hyperparameters (learning rates, regularization, etc.).\nAnd after being satisfied with the offline evaluations, we can always commit to train and test the model on the complete dataset.\nGiven that being said, all sorts of things we want to do to improve our model’s capability can benefit from a small but decent dataset. Obviously the size should not be like a few dozens of observations, cause it hurts with any statistical patterns we would like to learn. In my experience, a good minimum threshold is around 10K users and 5K items, with the sparsity being less than 99.9%.\n\nA note on sparsity\nWhat does it mean to have a decent RecSys dataset? One of the key criteria is sparsity—the ratio of observed interactions to all possible user-item pairs.\nTo understand why sparsity is problematic, consider the interaction matrix where each cell represents a potential user-item interaction:\n\n\n\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\nItem 3\nItem 4\nItem 5\nItem 6\n\n\n\n\nUser A\n5\n-\n4\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nUser B\n-\n3\n-\n-\n5\n-\n\n\nUser C\n-\n-\n-\n2\n-\n4\n\n\nUser D\n4\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n\nWhere numbers represent ratings (1-5) and “-” represents no interaction\nIn this tiny 4×6 example, only 7 out of 24 possible interactions are observed—giving us 71% sparsity. Real-world recommendation datasets often exceed 99% sparsity.\n\\[\n\\text{Sparsity} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{actual\\_interactions}}{\\text{num\\_users} \\times \\text{num\\_items}}\n\\]\nThe sparsity problem gets quadratically worse as datasets grow:\nSmall dataset example: \\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{users} &= 1,000, \\quad \\text{items} = 1,000 \\\\\n\\text{possible interactions} &= 1,000 \\times 1,000 = 1\\text{M} \\\\\n\\text{actual interactions} &= 50,000 \\\\\n\\text{sparsity} &= 1 - \\frac{50,000}{1,000,000} = 95\\%\n\\end{align}\\]\nLarger dataset example: \\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{users} &= 10,000, \\quad \\text{items} = 10,000 \\\\\n\\text{possible interactions} &= 10,000 \\times 10,000 = 100\\text{M} \\\\\n\\text{actual interactions} &= 500,000 \\\\\n\\text{sparsity} &= 1 - \\frac{500,000}{100,000,000} = 99.5\\%\n\\end{align}\\]\nEach new user adds an entire row of mostly empty interactions, and each new item adds an entire column of mostly empty interactions. Since users typically interact with only a tiny fraction of available items, the interaction matrix becomes increasingly sparse as the catalog grows.\nIn recommendation systems, interactions follow a long-tailed distribution—many users and items have only a few interactions. So while randomly sampling may work just fine for many ML use cases, we need to apply it a bit more carefully here. Ultimately we want to have a sample dataset where each user/item has at least X interactions.\nThe tricky part is that a basic random sampling of users and items would create sparsity cascade—a domino effect that breaks your dataset.\nHere’s what happens using our 4×6 matrix example: Let’s say User A has 2 interactions (Items 1 and 3), and Item 1 has 2 interactions (from Users A and D). Now suppose we randomly decide to remove User D during sampling. Suddenly Item 1 drops from 2 interactions to just 1 interaction from User A. If our minimum threshold is 2 interactions per item, Item 1 now becomes too sparse and gets removed. But removing Item 1 means User A loses one of their interactions and might fall below the minimum user interaction threshold as well.\nOriginal Matrix\n\n\n\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\nItem 3\nItem 4\nItem 5\nItem 6\n\n\n\n\nUser A\n5\n-\n4\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nUser B\n-\n3\n-\n-\n5\n-\n\n\nUser C\n-\n-\n-\n2\n-\n4\n\n\nUser D\n4\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n\nItem 1 has 2 interactions (Users A, D) ✓\nRemove User D\n\n\n\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\nItem 3\nItem 4\nItem 5\nItem 6\n\n\n\n\nUser A\n5\n-\n4\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nUser B\n-\n3\n-\n-\n5\n-\n\n\nUser C\n-\n-\n-\n2\n-\n4\n\n\nUser D\n4\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n\nItem 1 now has only 1 interaction (User A) ✗ - Below threshold!\nRemove Item 1 (below threshold)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\nItem 3\nItem 4\nItem 5\nItem 6\n\n\n\n\nUser A\n5\n-\n4\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nUser B\n-\n3\n-\n-\n5\n-\n\n\nUser C\n-\n-\n-\n2\n-\n4\n\n\n\nUser A now has only 1 interaction (Item 3) ✗ - Might fall below user threshold too!\nIt’s like pulling threads from a sweater—everything starts unraveling.\nAn iterative approach can be considered to deal with this kind of problem. We gradually drop random users from the dataset while watching our conditions and sampling targets. The trade-off is that while it’s hard to get an exact predefined number of users and items, we can control the minimum acceptable thresholds:\n\n\ncfg/common.yaml\n\nsample:\n  sample_users: 10000\n1  min_val_records: 5000\n  min_user_interactions: 5\n  min_item_interactions: 10\n\n\n1\n\nWe need to ensure sufficient validation data to evaluate our models.\n\n\nfrom src.sample import InteractionDataSampler\n\ndata_sampler = InteractionDataSampler(\n    user_col=cfg.data.user_col,\n    item_col=cfg.data.item_col,\n    sample_users=cfg.sample.sample_users,\n    min_val_records=cfg.sample.min_val_records,\n    random_seed=cfg.run.random_seed,\n    min_item_interactions=cfg.sample.min_item_interactions,\n    min_user_interactions=cfg.sample.min_user_interactions,\n    perc_users_removed_each_round=0.1,\n    debug=False,\n)\n...\n\nRandomly removing 2960 users - Round 18 started\nAfter randomly removing users - round 18: num_users=29,605\nNumber of users 29,605 are still greater than expected, keep removing...\n\nRandomly removing 2413 users - Round 19 started\nAfter randomly removing users - round 19: num_users=24,137\nNumber of users 24,137 are still greater than expected, keep removing...\nNumber of val_df records 4,282 are falling below expected threshold, stop and use `sample_df` as final output...\n\nlen(sample_users)=19,734 len(sample_items)=7,388\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractionDataSampler implementation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter sampling, we end up with 19,734 users and 7,388 items.

How does user-item rating data relate to sequences?\nTraditional collaborative filtering approaches like Matrix Factorization only use the user-item rating matrix. But one important signal gets left out: the timestamps.\nThe key insight is simple: when a user interacts with items over time, those interactions tell a story. We group each user’s interactions chronologically to create sequences of items, with the assumption that items a user engages with have meaningful relationships to each other.\nLet’s trace through an example to understand how sequence generation works.\nSuppose we have the following user interactions over time:\n\n\n\nTime\nItem Purchased\nItem Index\n\n\n\n\n1\nPython Programming\n42\n\n\n2\nMachine Learning\n73\n\n\n3\nDeep Learning\n91\n\n\n\n\nThis is the expected output in terms of the user-item sequence signals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow\nTarget Item\nItem Sequence\nPrevious Items\n\n\n\n\n1\n42 (Python Programming)\n[-1, -1, ..., -1]\nNo previous items\n\n\n2\n73 (Machine Learning)\n[-1, -1, ..., 42]\nPython book\n\n\n3\n91 (Deep Learning)\n[-1, -1, ..., 42, 73]\nPython, ML books\n\n\n\n\nThe function generate_item_sequences can be used to perform the sequence generation.\nfrom src.sequence.util import generate_item_sequences\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    \"user_indices\": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    \"item_indices\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n    \"timestamp\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n    \"ratings\": [1, 4, 5, 3, 2],\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Generate the item sequences\ndf_with_sequences = generate_item_sequences(\n    df,\n    user_col=\"user_indices\",\n    item_col=\"item_indices\",\n    timestamp_col=\"timestamp\",\n    sequence_length=3,\n    padding=True,\n    padding_value=-1,\n)\n\ndisplay(df_with_sequences)\n\nAs you can see, the above item_sequence column contains the sequence of items in chronological order which holds the context for the model to understand user preferences and make sequential predictions.\nIn this project, we use the user’s last 10 items as the sequence length, but this is configurable. The choice depends on experimentation, but generally there’s a trade-off: longer sequences provide more context but use more memory, while shorter sequences focus on recent items and process faster.\n\n\ncfg/common.yaml\n\ntrain:\n  sequence:\n    sequence_length: 10  # Keep last 10 items as context\n\nDo take note that we need to pad sequences to the same length so we can batch process them in our PyTorch model.\nWith our feature engineering pipeline complete, we now have transformed our raw Amazon Reviews data into model-ready sequences. Each user’s interaction history has been converted into numerical sequences that capture temporal patterns, while our ID mapping ensures consistent encoding across train and validation sets. These sequences will serve as the foundation for training our neural sequential recommendation model, providing the rich contextual information needed to predict what items users are likely to engage with next."

If our model only sees positive interactions (ratings), it can’t learn meaningful patterns for generalization. We need to generate negative examples so the model can distill the patterns by learning to distinguish between positive and negative interactions.\nContinue to the next chapter.\n\n If you find this tutorial helpful, please cite this writeup as:\n\nQuy, Dinh.
